Free speech rights are being called into question after assault allegations and tense moments at a private dinner party at the home of UC Berkeley faculty.

This happened during an annual dinner Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinksy and his wife Professor Catherine Fisk hold for students.

Now students are accusing Professor Fisk of assault.

Video shows the moments when Professor Fisk tries to take the microphone from a protester voicing support for the people in Gaza.

The protester then says ""You don't have to get aggressive,"" to which Fisk responds ""I'm not being aggressive.""

""Please leave our house. You are guests at our house,"" Chemerinsky can be heard saying.

The group protesting released a statement, saying in part:

""Fisk's assault was a symbol of the deeper Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism, and religious discrimination that runs rampant within the University of California administration.""

Chemerinksy did not want to speak on camera but responded to the incident with a statement saying, ""I am enormously sad that we have students who are so rude as to come into my home, in my backyard, and use this social occasion for their political agenda.""

UC Berkeley's Chancellor issued a statement saying while they support free speech, the university cannot condone using a private event for protest.

The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression agrees.

""There is this misconception that a lot of students have across the country right now that taking over someone else's event, disrupting their event is an exercise of first amendment rights and that's just wrong,"" said Nico Perrino, VP of the foundation.

Chemerinksy, who is Jewish, said he was recently the subject of antisemitic flyers posted on campus.

He says security will be present for two other dinners he has planned.","The funniest part of the event was when Fisk says ""we agree with you about Palestine"" and then the protesters say ""Then why have you done nothing about divestment?"" And they go ""we have no control over divestment"" and then the protesters just leave lmao
Yeah. Not a 1A violation and a law student should know it. The fact that a law student believes that should be grounds for dismissal. The selfishness and stupidity is astounding.
Berkeley is exhausting sometimes.
this just makes them look like fools i mean how will this look in the future, a law student that doesn‚Äôt understand the law???
""You don't have to get aggressive"" says a person trespassing on someone's private residence? I don't know what these protestors think they're accomplishing with this behavior. But it isn't anything they want.
Who do we think knows the 1A better - the hysterical 20 year old or the foremost constitutional scholar?
Performative narcissists
This is a lesson to Jews who think that ""good, secular and cooperating Jews"" will be spared by antisemites: Those were sent to the gas chambers as well.
Classic Hamas tactic: Get invited somewhere then overthrow it.
> The group protesting released a statement, saying in part: ""Fisk's assault was a symbol of the deeper Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism, and religious discrimination that runs rampant within the University of California administration.""

The other Palestinian-American groups at Cal must publicly denounce this one for such a stunt. Write an open letter and you'll have my signature as an alum. It's terrible to abuse a professor's hospitality and slander him, and it sets back their cause if they remain silent about it.
It‚Äôs on private property, what free speech?
Why no one is protesting the genocide that is happening in Yemen? Or Burma?
If anyone needs a refresher - 1A is not the right to protest whenever and wherever you want without consequences. Imagine if you were taking a Berkeley class and everyday a student in the class stood up and screamed for the entire lecture as a ""form of protest"". Is that fair for the other students? Or we can agree there is some limit and rules of civil order we have to maintain even while being able to speak our minds and protest - even on a college campus?
A graduating law student doesn‚Äôt realize free speech doesn‚Äôt apply to a private party AND that being asked to leave and not complying is ‚Ä¶ trespassing?  I‚Äôd be concerned about that if I were the Dean.  Are they getting a DEI pass?

While I‚Äôm here - this pro Hamas PR effort is huge, organized and well funded that took years to plan.  I‚Äôve been doing PR Comms for 20 years (Haas alum) and this is a wildly successful campaign.  Hope someone investigates and writes about it after the war is over.
It‚Äôs crazy that Berkeley paid Chermerinsky all kinds of money to pry him away from UCI and this is the thanks hey gets
What an asshole - invited to someones home for dinner and this is what she does‚Ä¶
Edgelord protestors. That‚Äôs crazy they don‚Äôt understand basic law about free speech. üé§
This seems like a staged effort at imitating a cancellation campaign. It seems like their goal was to punish those in charge of the school for not taking drastic enough actions, and to set a precedent over how future administrators should behave. These people are smart enough to know the Dean has little to do with divestment. Instead they just wanted to document themselves being victimized to put it online first and foremost.
Lol this is just a taste of future things to come. Fuck these stupid so called protestors on high horse. Just because you are a ‚Äúmuslim Palestinian woman in ramadan‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt give you a right to do whatever you want. Stop playing victim cards all the time
Private property. Trespassing. Call police on them.
Why is their move to protest everyone BUT the actual parties involved?
Hopefully no law firm will hire her.
Imagine these clowns being the future lawyers of this country. Yikes. Law students who can't even apply the basic principles of 1A. Expel them please!
I support the people of Palestine but things like this just make the cause look bad. How does trespassing on this guy‚Äôs house help at all?
How are these students not expelled yet?
This is not a ""free speech"" issue. The mouthy, entitled protestors have no legal standing under the First Amendment because they were on private property. In fact, the moment they were told to leave and failed to depart, they were the one committing a crime. Still, its entertaining to see a Berkely professor get a spoonful of her own crap.
It's worth mentioning that this guy is very pro Palestinian and even was a part of this movement during the current war. His only sin in their eyes is his Jewish last name.
What are they protesting?  The guy is an ally, but because he is Jewish, he is fair game?
The fliers told me all I needed to know. They did this because Chemerinsky is Jewish. And then across twitter and Instagram they‚Äôre spreading misinformation regarding this event.
I have a feeling she would be one of the people protesting certain speakers being allowed on campus yet somehow feels perfectly within her right to do something like this
Jesus Christ is this gonna be the new incident that‚Äôs posted 12 times a week here for the next 6 weeks
so indecent
Agreed with the profesor ! Go to your own back yard and protest ! Nobody cares
Stupid af
That‚Äôs not assault
What makes no sense is that Hamas is partially (mostly) funded by Iran and Iran is funding the aggressors in the Yemeni genocide (actually a genocide) and likely a major supplier in the Sudanese genocide as well. So genocide is all good when Iran supplies the weapons and funding.
I can't believe how many folks are labeling this as a chokehold - ick.
Its a private home.¬†
Without realizing it, this woman perfectly encapsulates Palestinian tactics. Start a problem, and then immediately declare victimhood and misrepresent what happened.

She made the response to her actions an assault on Islam üòÇ 

How dare they choke and touch the breasts of a Palestinian Muslim woman on the last day of Ramadan?!
I do not think those students know what ‚Äúassault‚Äù means
Imagine trespassing at someone‚Äôs home, causing a disturbance, and then accusing them of having a phobia after they ask you to leave
So because she is muslim she is supposed to get a free pass? Um isn't she on private property? Lmao she should try this in Texas.
Imagine supporting Hamas. Because that is what these people are doing.
Is childish to show up at someone‚Äôs house and throw a tantrum.
Islamophobia? ¬†More like asshole-ophobia .¬† People like this have no idea how much they are hurting their pet cause.¬†
How are these students not expelled yet?
Just watched her tiktok response video. A bunch of babble that left me with only one question: Why do these 'activists', regardless of ethnic background, always put on this kind of latent faux accent that is supposed to, I imagine, resemble a typical accent of the country their family originated from. So many times I've sat there watching these types and often find myself saying ""Girl you're from Florida, calm down"".
One thing is for sure. They don‚Äôt care about Gaza.
Im about to side fully with israel because of the pro palestinian protestors interupting dem fundraisers etc. I used to believe israel should work to end the war quickly and let humanitarian aid, now i want israel to keep going until these protestors go to the repubs because if trump gets back in do they think he will treat gaza better? He wont, but the protestors have changed hearts and minds, my own being one of them. I no longer care what happens to gaza
Jihadis gonna jihad.
It's just fucking repulsive to see these professional victim types use a genocide as a means to get their need to be a victim met, especially a law student. This lady clearly doesnt care about Gaza or else she would not push support away by lashing out in the private property of someone who can send donations or spread awareness if approached with respect and good faith. Like...calling someone a racist, bigot and pushing for their job position to be revoked won't make them support your cause. You cant expect compassion out of a stranger you insulted and threatened over something that she has nothing to do with. Like, a law student understands this. She did this on purpose to get attention and is using Gaza as a means to that end.
Forcibly removing a trespasser who refuses to leave ‚â† violation of free speech and assault.
The young, the woke, and the clueless. A new soap opera.  Loudly getting in people‚Äôs faces is not the same thing as social progress.

This reminds me of those BLM fools in 2020 preaching through megaphones at outdoor restaurants.
Im so glad im reading these opinions, instagram comment sections seem so woke
Isn‚Äôt this a classic Hamas and Palestinian playbook? Cause trouble, get consequences, play the victim?
Chermerinsky is not an Israel-Palestine scholar, he has not commented much on what is going on. The only thing he has said is he supports Palestinian rights, Palestinian autonomy, is against Netanyahu, and supports the 2 state solution. He even got so much flack for defending the family of an anti-Israel protestor who was almost (?) run over by an Israeli bulldozer on the left bank. He is a VERY reasonable man, and even if you think he should believe that Israel should be destroyed, he will probably sit down and have that conversation as long as it‚Äôs a logical one (although it‚Äôs probably difficult to have that conversation without being anti semitic :/). It‚Äôs quite clear Chermerinsky is only being targeted because he‚Äôs Jewish, which is really sad to see. 

This was so stupid. I truly feel for the protestor and imagine what her family and friends must be going through in Palestine is horrid, but putting her blatant anti Semitism aside (being completely ok with that anti semiotic graphic), this was just bad strategy. I hope all those protestors and students learn from this and become better lawyers with a higher standard of ethics and decorum moving forward.
What does ""free speech"" look like in Gaza? Can you speak against Hamas or speak in support of Gays or Jews or secularism?
They were protesting AT HIS HOUSE. If they don‚Äôt leave he has every right to smack them upside the head. It‚Äôs entirely private property.
They were protesting outside the Starbucks in downtown San Jose a few weeks ago. I watched the whole thing (it was across the street from my house). 

I still do not understand exactly what they want Starbucks to do. I don't understand why they think San Jose's city council ""condemning"" Israel is going to change anything. 

I feel like political activism has undergone a significant shift in the last 20 years. People used to have specific demands and policy proposals they were rallying behind - like The Civil Rights Act or legalizing gay marriage. Now it is ridiculous ideas like ""defund the police"" and harassing people who have no power over a situation to ""condemn"" some behavior. 

To me everyone looks like those Westboro Baptist Church people. Tactics are indistinguishable.
simple solution: tell Hamas to stop commiting terrorist attacks... done...
People just want to have a dinner, but hey, here‚Äôs my problem and if you don‚Äôt agree I‚Äôll play victim
So you show up at someone's house uninvited, then play the victim when they get mad that you REFUSE to leave?

Calling it a protest doesn't make you less of an asshole.
[removed]
Expel them all
She‚Äôs trying to argue about constitution speech rights to the greatest conditional scholar of our time (and she‚Äôs dead wrong). What an absolute ding dong
Those students are nothing more than terrorists. Lock them up.
I get that sometimes Karens will throw out, ""fIrSt AmMeNdMeNt!!!11!!1!"" without fully understanding that it doesn't apply to private entities in the same way it does to public ones, but how are law students at UC Berkeley making the same mistake? That is absolutely shameful.

These students aren't getting their free speech violated or suppressed; they are trespassing illegally and belong in handcuffs.
it‚Äôs insane to me how small the subset of people that know what free speech is is.
i hope that antisemitic idiot gets expelled.
No wonder there has been a drop in Berkeley acceptances. This is a big hit to the Berkeley reputation.
The strength oh Americans supporting terrorists is great. USA lost its mind. Loving criminals, hating police, appreciating war criminals, hating victims. Plus middle age traditions back to life. LOL, and with all that they demand the rest of the world kisses their soft a\*s
Palestinian protestors are a bunch of fucking goobers.
Oddly they never choose to divest from Israeli created medicines and medical treatments.

Zero respect for someone else's home which is odd because there's a lot of respect expected back. There are public protests every day and this lunatic had to pick harassing people at their home (they look like wacko too tbh). And they lawyer having zero respect for private property... they should have just called the cops for trespassing after they refused to leave.
This is just pure nonsense and no case
Oh no how terrible. Anyways.
Reap what you sow
rAcIsM
Did they hold up signs that said ‚ÄúFree the hostages ‚Äú ?
God these protestors are so fucking stupid. I'm seriously done with this as an alum, it gives Berkeley such a bad name (and I agree with them in several ways when it comes to political values).
Idiots.
The title makes it seem like a group of protestors came into their house and caused a scene. These law students were invited to his house and tried making a statement about divestment when the professor tried to stop the student from speaking by grabbing the mic from her. They got into an argument where the professor took the microphone from her, then the student and the other protestors left.
I hear Stanford is nice.
Bha
Berkeley is on their side but they bite the hand that feeds goes into her own house? Maybe know she will see they are lunatics‚Ä¶
Maybe she'll intern for Pamela Price?
Just another soulless professor trending the UC system downward. Put a Gen Xer or millennial to replace these soulless.
Leaving aside the law for a minute, why do people have no class anymore?
As a culture we need to start pushing back against the ridiculous misuse of words like ‚Äúassault‚Äù
 Even if a person is a government official unless given permission to accompany them, it is tresspassing to go on their private property. Even journalists filming police have to follow this law. Even portions of public property are legally allowed to be off limits to the public. Misrepresenting oneself to gain consent to follow a government official

Fire her!
She should've been u touch imma knock you out
Well palestinians could have their own zone and land taken during the war would go to palestinians unless it was specific gistoric monuments that needed to be kept neutral or beong to a certain zone. Palestinians could live in any zone they want as long as they respect the ancestral culture of that zone. Religious fundamentalism would be very taboo for any zone. The bedouin zine could be an overlapping zone where their traditionak routes go through as long as they equally respect the rights of the overlapping zone.
[removed]
How are these students at these prestigious institutions of higher learning so dumb? I don't get it, one would think you would have to be pretty smart to get accepted but things like this and seeing so many protesters admitting they don't really know why or what they're protesting doesn't make sense.
These people are so entitled they genuinely thought this would be a win for them. Reasonable people are running away screaming from these protestors.
With the recent climate going on around college campuses, I‚Äôm wondering if the owner of this home put any prior thought into what might happen inviting these students to his private domain.¬†
[deleted]
History‚Äôs most effective protests were undertaken by people doing as much as they could with the platforms they had, and they were all disruptive and met with backlash. Berkeley especially is known for to be a hotbed for passionate student activism, and is a large reason why many people choose to apply & attend. Anyone saying this is ‚Äúshocking‚Äù or ‚Äúout of line‚Äù for student protestors should be reminded that quiet, unassuming protests far from the halls of power are never the ones that affect change.

So, when politically-active students are *personally invited* to the house of their Dean (for a celebration dinner held during the fasting days of Ramadan, no less), a university official who is supposed to represent and advocate for them, and express that they feel unsafe and unwelcome on campus by Dean Chereminsky‚Äôs open support of Zionism, they are utilizing the most seemingly-effective platform they have to voice their opinions and ask for a response (which the Dean has previously failed to provide). AKA *what protestors do.* 

Even in Chemerinsky‚Äôs recent statement, he conflates anti-Zionism with anti-semitism and fails to address the protestor‚Äôs grievances in any way except to insinuate that they are anti-semites. Coming from a Dean, it‚Äôs disappointing at best and divisive at worst. 

Were Chemerinsky and Fisk legally justified in removing the student? Yes, though they absolutely should not have put hands on her in that way. It‚Äôs bad optics regardless of your side of the aisle. My point is, we ought to give each other the benefit of the doubt: maybe these aren‚Äôt ‚Äúclout-chasing virtue signalers,‚Äù they‚Äôre genuinely passionately students with Palestinian friends and families. Maybe they‚Äôre not actually trying to incite anti-semitism on campus because they hate Jews, they‚Äôre trying to persuade the university‚Äôs most influential faculty members and receive a definitive response on an issue they care about.
Yall are critiquing this protest as if they just randomly came to his home. This is a Berkeley Law event, if you are protesting your school by way of that, school events would be the target of protest this is a really simple concept.
Does anyone commenting here even lives in Berkeley? I doubt that.
Hell yeah
The profs fostered a community like this so I enjoy watching them suffer tbh.
Freedom of speech and expression is only for those who speak the right way on the right subjectsüòî
Hot take: Muslims and Jews should inter-marry and be barred from religious identity for 2-3 generations.
""First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; 

""who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; 

""who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; 

""who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; 

""who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" 

""Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."" - MLK
Yes, they‚Äôre *unintentionally* displacing 2 million people from the last bit of Palestine after successfully displacing them from the rest of it.


And that makes it much better! Woohoo western morality is so awesome
U.C.Berkeley paid for the event, there should be no expectation of privacy at this professor's home.
Sad to see them attack students like that at law school sponsored event
Professors should be fired.
Wait Berkeley can't protest because protesting something they don't like is not the right protest?
Lmfao. Free Palestine, from the river to the sea üáµüá∏üçâ
what's complete bullshit is that this is an event for law school grads using public money... they have no right to suppress free speech at essentially a public event using public money from a public university  funds

they also deceptively cut the clip on the main Twitter video that is circulating but on the longer video she didn't even say anything about Palestine when she had the mic pulled from her
Apparently this professor gives land acknowledgements during her classes. The Karen mind is insane.
Gotta admit that picture looks bad for the white lady
Wasn't she invited to the event and given the microphone to give a speech, if you see the video, the lady tried stopping her after she said a greeting in Arabic. You young bluds need to chill
So no ‚Äúfree speech?‚Äù 
Entitled white fucks.
Anything critical of Israel is instantly labeled as antisemitic. I fucking hate this current timeline. We got the bad fucking ending. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòí
She should be fired. No matter what they were saying, whether you agree or disagree, YOU CANNOT USE PHYSICAL FORCE. Even if this was a zionist event I would have said the same. No physical touch
A lot of you berkeley libs are down playing an active genocide and it makes me weep for the future
Law students could point out that actually looks more like a battery
Based as fuck protestors.
[deleted]
They then use their iPhones not realizing how many Israeli tech patents are part of it!
ok but now I'm confused. does the law school invest in Israel, yes or no? in the video, the dean says no, but is that true?
It is liberal, left-wing Jews -- Jews in name only -- who are responsible for harboring these Islamofascist terrorists, out of their anti-white and anti-western guilt. Just like in Maoist struggle sessions, no confessions or admissions of guilt will EVER be satisfying to the dominant hateful group -- here, students who support Hamas terrorism.
[deleted]
it's extra sad bc Chemerinsky does the barbri con law lectures.....many fine people know this is not a 1A violation bc they learned it from the man she's accusing of violating the first amendment lmao
And the sheer amount of entitlement. ""Support my cause, or you are the scum of the earth.""
The fact that they are standing there arguing 1A against Chemerinsky, one of the foremost 1A authorities, in his home also speaks to their selfishness and stupidity.
No question. Expel the student. Bye!!!
Cuz Berkeley decided to stop giving real grades to their law students. Kek, no one knows if she actually read the first amendment and the cases
[deleted]
Agreed.  The fact that these ‚Äúlaw‚Äù students think the first amendment allows them to burst into someone‚Äôs private home to start yelling at them shows either how poorly the university is doing educating its students, or how much it‚Äôs lowered its admissions standards to promote diversity.  In either case, they are an embarrassment to the Berkeley School of Law.
It‚Äôs all bad faith far left activism. ¬†It‚Äôs the Berkeley trademark. ¬†
>1A

It is because it's a public university. They can't have a university associated function and also suppress free speech. Even events in private property if they're associated with the university can be covered. It gets complicated fast.

>Dismissal

Would be terribly tone deaf and likely lead to way more lawsuits. These students are trying to do good and they didn't hurt anyone beyond feelings.
Is it always like this? It's the best school I've been accepted to but the subreddit makes it seem like a social warzone. Although I'm well aware that a subs dedicated to any institution tend to suffer from intense negative selection bias.
It‚Äôs actually toxic. I worked with some brilliant people at Cal and I loved my time as a PhD there but the toxic activism is wild. I basically was the target of a harassment campaign my last year during the strike.
College activist culture in general sucks. People who are 18-22 should mostly be focused on themselves rather than getting involved in high stakes causes before they have real-word experience and emotional maturity. College should be more about understanding the world and less about trying to change it.
That protesting chick is a flat out a-hole.¬†
I'm genuinely curious how this shakes out in their moral character and fitness examination, and whether Dean Chemerinsky might be compelled to write a letter to the State Bar. Real dumb behavior right before the State decides whether you get to be an attorney or not.
They don‚Äôt give a shit. ¬†Law is full of far left extremist activism and almost all of it is rewarded or at least unpunished.
I hate these protest tactics. When people act very aggressively and rudely, but are overly sensitive to any perceived misdeed and gaslight and pretend like they care about keeping the peace
""think"" ????
They tried to take her mic away! She was basically genocided.
Yeah i don't care how evil someone claims a person is. They do have the right to be left alone on their own property unless they directly harming a person in that moment.
how were they trespassing if they were invited to the house? once the dean opened his home to an university event, the policies of the university apply to there as well so the student is within their right to protest‚Ä¶ also you don‚Äôt go assaulting anyone who you disagree with even if they are at your home, you ask them to leave and if they don‚Äôt leave you call the police
This was a university paid dinner for which she was invited as a Berkeley law 3rd year student. Is Reddit the only news source you‚Äôre on?
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to get aggressive.‚Äù says an Israeli soldier to a Gazan great-grandmother, whose girlhood home was Bethlehem.
I mean, he didn't say they weren't in their rights to speak, cuz they are. And he didn't try to take the phone/microphone because that's not clearly legal. I think dude played it right, woman got a little more hands on than necessary and maybe pay consequences for it.
The moment things chill out over there, Palestine will be like a fart in the wind to all these people
I mean they're actually doing something within their power here, not doing a lot of show boating, were calm etc... seems like a decent protest. Not sure how you'd do it better tbh
OMG, so true and I say this all the time. Back in the 1930s, there were tons of secular, assimilated SELF-HATING JEWS in Europe and in Germany.... they thought since they were integrated into society, and spouted the same anti-Jewish tropes as their German/Nazi pals... they wouldn't go to the gas chambers. But they did. 

I thought we had learned this lesson -- boy was I ever wrong! only 90 years -- within the living memories of some very elderly people still -- and the same anti-Jewish hate is being spewed all over media and protests in support of Hamas terrorists only 22 years after 9/11.....
LOL... what race exactly are Palestinians? They are Arab Muslims, and no different racially than any Jew. Both Jews and Arabs are semitic and from the same region. Jews are not ""white"" in the racial sense and certainly Hitler did not consider us to be ""white"".

FIsk grabbed the microphone of a nasty little beyotch who was spoiling the student dinner. There is no way this was ""assault"". The student was trespassing and only attended to stage this ""event"" for TikTok.
Professor Fisk is a woman, I‚Äôm going to assume you are not well informed about what happened.
Exactly. You can ask anyone to leave your private property for pretty much any reason.
There is no ""private property""! It's all [sacred native land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNDxl5xZiAA), or something like that.
The dinner was paid by the university and it was for Berkeley law students, that‚Äôs who she is.
""But, but surely it's on stolen land!"" ü§£
[deleted]
Or Sudan
Because this is no more than performative narcissism.¬†
Because they don't care about those countries. The left's involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict has much more to do with ideology than legitimate humanitarian concerns.
Doesn‚Äôt involve ‚Äúthe Jews‚Äù so why would they be mad?
No Jews, no news.
Because you then the people wearing the hijabs and keffiyehs can't blame  (((them)))
No Jews, No News
""That's different.""
because the united states isn‚Äôt unconditionally backing and funding the aggressors in those conflicts
The Burma one is old news, it‚Äôs not correctly happening, or am I wrong?

The Yemen one has escalated as a direct result of Israeli aggression, and people have been speaking out against it for years now.
Because it is not and never was about ""genocide"". It is about rampant Jew hatred. The protests for the last 6 months are staged and well funded by leftist groups, Qatar and Iraq (probably China too!). They are not arising organically, but consist mostly of students and young people ginned up with rage from absurdly inaccurate TikTok videos.
Or Syria?
Where should we go to protest the genocide in Burma? Rangoon?
because our government isn‚Äôt directly funding them‚Ä¶
Because the US isn't so directly involved in those.
I don‚Äôt understand this argument. Like because other genocides are happening and people are not protesting ALL of them, then people shouldn‚Äôt protest any genocides?
Or Nigeria
I don‚Äôt see you talking about Yemen or Burma either buddy seems like you just hate Palestine
[deleted]
Why do you only care about those genocide when people are protesting the Gaza genocide?
Because your average Jewish person will deny the Palestinian genocide. But you don‚Äôt have anyone defending the other genocides.
How many bombs and F-35s did we give Yemen and Burma?
There were protests. They went ignored. Why? Because they weren‚Äôt disruptive enough.
Less so because 

1. The US is directly funding and enabling the genocide with our tax dollars and

2. the genocide in Gaza has been much more fatal, with over 40,000 civilians killed (excluding starvation) in just 6 months. With Israel breaking countless resolutions and international law and laws of war.
Trye. Free speech is the right to be heard. Not to force it onto someone by getting in their face. That's harassment. Free speech does not give people the right to harass others. That would then require one to have freedom of action which there is not right to.
That party was paid by the university. So it‚Äôs not ‚Äòprivate‚Äô anymore.
Sounds like it was poorly planned. However, protests ought to be disruptive to be successful, private party or not. Eventually, when there will be riots over the issue, I‚Äôm sure people won‚Äôt be crying ‚Äúfree speech doesn‚Äôt apply at private parties‚Äù when they start throwing Molotovs.

The Dean is staunchly Zionist and has issued no statement of support for Palestinians. They should‚Äôve demanded the statement from the Dean before disbanding.
the money was pre-compensation for all the shit that they knew he'll have to put up with
Zot Zot
There are plenty of opportunities in law school to try and make a case for supporting a cause like this. A private dinner at the dean's home is absolutely not the right time or place. Of course this ahole of a student accomplished what she set out to - she got visibility for her cause and showed the world what an absolute terrible person she is. Congrats I guess...
They don't understand or accept consequences for their own choice to cross the line.


This has been a besetting sin in the so called peace movement for decades.


It's why I gave up on this particular crowd.


Performative narcissism is right. Moral narcissism, too.
There were invited to the dinner. You can't invite people then charge them with trespassing immediately. You have to let them know they are uninvited and ask them to leave. If then they refuse to leave you can call the police. But immediately resort to physical assault is also illegal.
Honestly as far as I can tell there‚Äôs a belief that any and all Jews are fair game to protest. Which itself is antisemitism. Sadly
Because they know they won‚Äôt face the kind of backlash that comes with going after the actual terrorists. These snowflakes wouldn‚Äôt last a day in Gaza.
Because these people don‚Äôt know what they are protesting. This is the problem with modern activism, outrage over everything but things you should be actually outraged over. They also know if they tried this shit in places with the actual people involved they would probably get arrested. They want to feel good protesting without actually doing anything meaningful for the causes they support
Then I will hire her for sure.
It's okay, this shows that we can compete with Stanford: [https://twitter.com/mythinformedmke/status/1634564006370242560](https://twitter.com/mythinformedmke/status/1634564006370242560)

She didn‚Äôt. The dinner was paid by the university, for Berkeley law students, that‚Äôs who she is.

I hope Professor Cherminksy (sp?) is having a deep contemplation right now of what his self-hating, anti-Jewish beliefs have led to.... that he has made himself a victim of pro-Hamas, pro-terrorist extremism in his insane support of Jew-haters.
To the ‚ÄúRiver to the sea‚Äù extremists, anyone who supports the existence of the Jewish state in any portion of the Jewish indigenous homeland is not an ally.
Jew here. I hate the Israeli government, the settlers, the right wing parties, and support the autonomy of the Palestinian people. This clusterfuck did nothing to help ""the cause"" and IMO reflects extremely badly on the pro-Palestinian student movement as a whole. 


Nice job Malak.
I don‚Äôt have a dog in this fight, but I will only say that the fliers portrayed dismissive racial stereotypes, and that if any other minority ethnic group was targeted in such a way, I believe that UCB would be in full activation.
I can't tell whether the right adjective is indecent, juvenile, ignorant, or narcissistic, but it's certainly a vile combination of all of those.
Genocide is also all good when it was literally in the Hamas Gaza charter.
People don‚Äôt like the truth if it makes them feel bad.
Genocide is anything you can blame on (((them))).
Everyone loves to give their opinion and recounting facts of the matter but fails to realize how much time they‚Äôre wasting
These are the same people who argue there should not be criminal law at all so yeah. F them.
Jews don't have a right to defend ourselves. We're dangerous hyper white nazis ü§™
Start war -> receive response -> claim response is aggression -> use response as justification for more violence -> repeat.
And of course, spread lies and propaganda on what happened even though it is very easy to view several videos contradicting their claims.

Especially when you were the one posting antisemitic posters of them all over campus weeks before, demanded that they cancel the dinner ""or else"" and were warned NOT to disrupt the event, but did so anyway, which included bringing your own microphone and sound system. And then refusing to leave after you are asked to do so over a dozen times. And THEN you accuse the hosts of everything imagineable and play the victim.
No, she should try this in Palestine/Gaza. Where women are treated soooo well.
How many times are you going to post the same clueless comment, hmm? Wasn‚Äôt enough you didn‚Äôt get the response the first time?
Wow are you tragic. Hop in trashbag üóëÔ∏è
Apparently they don‚Äôt care about understanding how laws work either, because they think 1A lets you trespass private property
None of them do lmao. People pick and choose what causes to support based on how popular they are. There are numerous human right violations and whatnot going on in the world right now but people only choose what everyone else cares about
It‚Äôs all performative. Look at me, me, me and how righteous I am.¬†
‚ÄúI want israel to keep going‚Ä¶ I no longer care what happens to gaza‚Äù‚Ä¶. Because of annoying protestors? Are you serious right now? that‚Äôs all your morals and principles amount to? Over 10,000 children dead, over 200 aid workers, at least 85 journalists. hospitals and libraries destroyed. famine. one woman had twins after trying for 10 years to get pregnant, and now they‚Äôre both dead, as is her husband and 11 more of her family members. And you want this to continue? that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying?
Instagram is horrible. Tiktok is even worse.
What is Woke about them?

Using the word ""woke"" like that makes smart people think you're stupid.
Also ironic that a lot of the people supporting them would probably be jailed or outright executed in PalestineüíÄ
yep: Launch missiles at civilians and launch a terror attack against 1k people, and then cry victim.   


Let's be real they could strike the new world trade center and these people on campus would still be supporting them.
Yes
Absolutely!
Are you seriously calling this girl ‚ÄúHamas‚Äù lol
""hope all those protestors and students learn from this and become better lawyers with a higher standard of ethics and decorum moving forward""

Very unlikely that this will happen.
The chances are that this young woman is not even Palestinian and has no family there... she may well be Iranian or Yemeni for all we know. She is just a Jew-hater using current events to justify her self-promotion on TikTok.
When Hamas was elected in 2005.... they immediately MURDERED all their political opponents. Seriously. Look it up.

So, no... you do not dare speak against Hamas, because they will KILL YOU. And I mean Arab Muslims here.

Gays? thrown off buildings, then stoned.

Women? honor killings all the time. Forced child marriages. Get raped? they kill YOU, not your rapist. 

This is now what American leftists support in the Middle East. There is NO free speech there of any kind, nor a free press. 

They are Hamas terrorists.
They were invited
I agree that it was wrong of them to do this someone‚Äôs private party. You are saying that this is how all Muslim students are and that there is no peace with these people whilst making fun of their traditions. Whatever you said isn‚Äôt addressing any issue of this problem instead it just sounds like your fueling your hatred for them and this situation is perfect for you to be able to do that. Idk how this comment even has upvotes.
Chemerinsky is a squish. There will be no consequences.
Anecdotal but IME It isn‚Äôt (by and large) Palestinian professors. It‚Äôs largely shitty Americans and a smattering of the grandchildren of rich Arabs who sold their land to Jews and bounced before partition or in the following years.  Most of the legit Palestinians I‚Äôve met are far more constructively minded than this. Obviously sample issues there (even when I‚Äôve been in the territories, the people I‚Äôve been talking to are the ones willing to talk to me) but nonetheless.
Or Israeli microchips in computers. Or Israeli cellphone technology. 

Meanwhile, please name all the innovations by Gazans. Or Palestinians in general. Or honestly, any country in the whole Middle East which is awash in trillions of oil dollars. I'll wait. (It will be a long wait.)

The scary part is that this young woman is graduating this month as a LAWYER!!!!
For some reason you're omitting the parts where her org made posters about boycotting the dinner with a caricature of the professor holding a bloody fork and knife and that the professor repeatedly asked her to leave and she refused, thereby trespassing.

Those parts seem relevant.
Yeah he legally has the right to kick a person off his property and claim they are trespassing, even if it's just for not looking what they have to say while on his private property. Content of the speech doesnt matter.
She has fully admitted she planned this ""event"" with 8 other law students, specifically to harass Professor Chemerinksy... because he is Jewish (or at least, he has a Jewish last name). She had posted anti-Jewish posters of him, including anti-Jewish tropes & slurs PRIOR to the dinner!!! This was all done to make a viral TikTok... so yes, they came on an invite but abused that to stage this ""scene"".

Yeah man I can man handle people that won‚Äôt leave my property lol. FAFO
I personally think people should listen to Jews when they feel they‚Äôre experiencing or witnessing antisemitism. Why are Jews the only group whose experience of their own discrimination is discredited by those on the left who are ‚Äúagainst discrimination‚Äù?
I think it‚Äôs funny to complain about Chereminsky ‚Äúconflating‚Äù (doubt) anti-Zionism with antisemitism, while going about saying his and Fisk‚Äôs response was entirely derived from Islamophobia.
Or maybe get a real job ? And then use that money to donate for the efforts ? Everyone in Berkeley already knows about Palestine. It‚Äôs like preaching to the choir. Go spread awareness in ALABAMA or something. Breh
I do not live there NOW, but I did some years back. I attended art college just down the road and I could easily walk to the Berkeley gates from my Berkeley apartment. Good old days!
Jews & Muslims intermarry all the time. Jews intermarry mostly with Christians, but with all other religions & races. Something like 60% of Jews marry outside their religion. 

Do you equally wish to bar Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and other religions from their own faith? or only Jews & Muslims?

BTW: Jews do not hate Islam as a RELIGION nor seek to prohibit it. Ever been to Israel? there are many mosques and Islamic holy sites, all protected under RELIGIOUS FREEDOM (which does not exist in the rest of the Middle East).
Those darn whites won't let me do whatever **I** want on **their** property. This is all **their** fault!

Any reasonable person, including yourself, would eject or remove a trespasser in their home. This isn't about the failings of the white moderate, this is about people who think they can do whatever they want without consequence whenever it comes at the expense of a white person (or in this case, a Jewish person).
Perhaps if you focused your energy on Hamas surrender, Palestinians would be better off
Fuck around, find out. Wars suck, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt start them or allow maniacs to start them in your name.¬†
Even public places can limit access to certain members of the public if they so choose. Museums do this all the time.
It doesn't matter; you do not give up your rights as a homeowner (or a renter) just because you host a party that your employer paid for. 

  
Sorry, epic fail.
Yeah these students are really gonna help this way great job‚Ä¶nobody is gonna respect them or their opinions like this
Attack students, lol. Get a small grip.

She is a law student she should know better that she doesn't have free speech protections or rights in a private home. She just embarrassed herself. Homeowner has every right to kick her and her group out.
Any proof that this was a sponsored event?
Why?¬†
[deleted]
If your reaction to this whole ordeal is ""WeLl YoU DoN't hAvE FrEe SpEeCh RiGhTs oN PrIvAtE PrOpErTy""...you are violently missing the point.
Imagine clutching your pearls over your fancy dinner being interrupted by nonviolent protestors while innocent people in Gaza are being crushed by humanitarian airdrops that civilians in refugee camps the size of major US cities have to fight over to feed their starving families. 

The victim mindset is crazy, I wish these people could just try to have a soul that is capable of basic human empathy. I just kinda feel like the sanctity of innocent human life is more important than enjoying your 5 course meal?
Which ""white lady""? the girl in the hijab? she is as white as the elderly lady who told her to stop using the party as a political platform.

ISLAM IS NOT A RACE. It is a religion. Muslims can be of any race.... semitic, white, black, asian.
She brought her own microphone. You know, like people do. Not.¬†
How about if I come into your home and whip out a bullhorn to start making a speech? You can‚Äôt interfere at all because those are my ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù rights, isn‚Äôt that what you claim?
Yes, having racist carictures drawn of oneself down on one's own private property really encapsulates the white european experience. Im sure, white christians deal with this every day üëç
Can I, as an invited guest in your home, whip out a bullhorn and give a speech accusing you of being a genocide supporter, and then declare myself the victim of racism when asked to leave? That‚Äôs what this is about.
TECHNICALLY... no, criticism of Israel is not anti-Jewish. Jews themselves hotly debate such issues among themselves. Israel has a robust free press, and newspapers like Ha'artez are VERY left wing.

But to be honest... outside of Israel, it is very hard or impossible to separate Jew-hatred from ""criticism"". And a lot of what you see in media for the last 6 months has been pro-Hamas, anti-Jewish propaganda that uses ""zionism"" as a buzzword to let them spew anti-Jew hatred.
In my own home? ¬†I‚Äôll kick your ass. Once you‚Äôve been asked to stop and leave, all bets are off.¬†
If someone is harassing you on your own property, you do have the right to physical force.
You don‚Äôt have to be lib or conserv to know it‚Äôs not a genocide.
Even if it was it Doesn't give a reason to harass a person who doesn't even support a genocide and sysoend their rights just for disagreeing with you. That's very fascist.
It's ironic that they are ""based"" as clout chasers rather than meaningful protestors.

Second link is directly to the full video where you can hear that part, lol.
No I wasn't it says it in one of the articles about it
[removed]
For what it is worth, this is a moral standard many people are willing to bite the bullet on. Taking an extreme stance as example, for someone who wishes for Israelis to not exist, yet is still willing to buy a phone reliant on Israelis to obtain such seems to have the same moral quandry as someone who wish slaveholders to not exist, yet is still willing to buy a phone reliant on slaveholders to obtain.
One of the dumbest arguments ever made that people continue to use today, I don‚Äôt know why people still use it and think they are saying something of substance.
Genuinely curious‚Ä¶how many Israeli patents are in a smart phone?
Correct!
I‚Äôm not sure you do either!

Nor nazi inventions.
Vuvuzuela iPhone McDonald
People can participate in society and critique it too, crazy I know.
The protesters are complaining about the UC system and something that these people have no control over.
The vast majority of Jews are zionists so no.
Ironic that they accuse the professor of ""weaponizing law enforcement"" by threatening to call the police, when in the video the student actually suggests they call the police and the professor says she doesn't want to do that.
Generation of Entitled fucks going to doom us
Ugh why is the person tweeting this such a loser, I agree but I really hate when legitimate criticism of a pro-Palestinian protest is jumped upon by all the anti-masker, right wing weirdos‚Ä¶
The kind who‚Äôs probably an Islamist?
>without being asked to leave

I mean, they can ask. But they can't force you out unless you're posing a threat (they aren't). And during that time you can say what you want. Also complicated by the event being put on or associated with a public school.
I know right? It‚Äôs so entitled to think genocide is bad
Follow Vanderbilt's example!
U still say kek there‚Äôs no way u aren‚Äôt over 30 years old n on a watchlist
And she was able to get into Berkeley Law, in some part, because she has a story. Muslim women etc.  I bet she is a shit student. 

Fuck her, kick her out and give her spot to a more deserving candidate.
They aren‚Äôt trying to do good. The dean is not a decision maker in the Israeli government or the US government. They are crashing an invite only party and harassing a faculty member because he is Jewish. If the dean was not Jewish they wouldn‚Äôt have done this.
The irony of you critiquing the actions of the world's preeminent first amendment scholar as a violation of the first amendment is hilarious.¬†
A public university has to juggle ALL constitutional rights at the same time. Everything they do is a function of that document and the federal interpretation and execution of it. 1A does not mean nothing else can happen if someone wants to say something.  
   
In fact, it often necessitates infringing upon it to uphold the others - which is why the government approves time and place to protest - because if they didn't, others' rights would be trampled by protesters' whims.
Hmm, I wonder what would happen if you used your expert knowledge of 1A and public universities to protest at Cal graduation by rushing the stage and speaking at the microphone? 

By your logic, there's nothing the University could do at that point. You are exercising your right to free speech at a public event on public property, right?

Wrong. You'd be immediately trespassed and removed from both the stage and the event by security. Depending on what you do in response, Cal will pursue further legal action.
It can be but you don‚Äôt have to engage in a lot of it tbf
Honestly if you don't pay attention to it you won't really notice but downside is that some protestors are very disruptive and it can get tiring seeing them even online.
Nah most people don‚Äôt care tbh
The broader majority of students do not participate in political activism. Most people are just attending classes, socializing, and worrying about what they‚Äôre going to do after school. I attended during the entire alt-right fixating on Cal and claiming it‚Äôs anti-free speech, most people just ignore stuff.

The law students in this protest are honestly really stupid. I support Palestine and believe that Israel is committing a genocide, but to act like this was assault is stupid. They were invited into the Dean‚Äôs home. Once they caused a disruption they were asked to leave multiple times, at that point they are trespassing and as the owner of the property they are within their rights to use appropriate force to remove them. While I support the same cause as these students, it‚Äôs clear that they don‚Äôt even think about the consequences they might face.
It is bad but you probably won‚Äôt personally wind up in any situations if you just keep to yourself. I speak from experience.
You honestly can go through your whole degree and avoid this shit pretty easily.
I used to just put my headphones in to walk across Sproul to go past protestors. It‚Äôs totally fine.
Most students I know don't have time to do anything like this tbh. I spend all my time fighting for my life with my coursework
Nah bro. Most berkeley students are pretty normal. This subreddit nor these videos are representatives of the students here.
Kinda.  I was there in the 90s when the city remodeled People's Park so a bunch people got their panties in a wad and rioted.  Riot police was called in and tear gas was fired.  I just go around that area on my way to class.
Its been that way for more than half a century. you slowly get desensitized and get good at making popcorn. the entire country constantly has a spotlight on the school get used to it lol.
They‚Äôve been famous for this for 50 years at least. Doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be part of it, but it must be hard to avoid.
Literally no lol. The day to day is not like this and I‚Äôm sad to see many at this campus engage in blatant antisemitism and then cry discrimination when rightfully accused of such.
You can just go to class and not even notice it 99% of the time. One time some fools were blocking the gate and got mad when I went through, even then I could've avoided it if I really wanted.
I would just be aware of your friend circle. Use the buddy system and make sure you end up with a good roommate.
What other schools have you been accepted to? I'm not convinced that university prestige guarantees the best *undergrad* experience. Or did you mean for law school?
It‚Äôs still worth going to. ¬†Good school and good price for instate. ¬†Just avoid all the politics.


¬†Odds are you‚Äôre liberal going in but four years of Berkeley might turn you conservative (or at least centrist). Or who knows maybe you‚Äôll move further left!
Have you studied American history at all? To question whether Berkley has always been like this means you have no understanding of the school whatsoever. Downvote me all you want folks, but of any school in the nation - asking if Berkeley has always been the center of protest is laughable.
That's unfortunate, I'm sorry you experienced that. I am a PhD student here and the worst experience I had during the strike was a student asked me to consider going home instead of continuing up the hill to the labs. I agree that students seem to get swept up in a fervor here on a regular basis - something I never saw at my undergrad - but my experience has been that I can avoid engaging with it if I want to.
Would look awful for him to punish them for a protest where literally no one was hurt beyond feelings lol
It doesn't matter how much I agree with someone's cause, I have no respect for people who disrupt events, block streets, or threaten regular people. There are only a small number of extreme circumstances where that stuff is okay.
What is a ""think?"" Is it edible?
Israel planned it
As soon as the Dean disinvited her and asked her to leave and she refused, it was legally considered trespassing
If I invite someone to a party and then they try to take over that party to make it a rally for their political cause of the day, I would not be happy with them.
[deleted]
No, it was a private birthday party.
>I mean, he didn't say they weren't in their rights to speak, cuz they are. 

He did say they didn't have a First Amendment right to speak. 

>And he didn't try to take the phone/microphone because that's not clearly legal. 

Or he just didn't want to? Rights are not obligations.  If someone is trying to stab me, I have a right to use deadly self-defense. I don't need to exercise that right.
I think it is very clearly legal to kick someone off of your patio.
When the election ends and the social media propaganda dies down and traditional media isn‚Äôt getting ratings because they‚Äôve burned everyone out on the conflict, then they‚Äôll move on to something else.

But it‚Äôs not gonna chill out over there anytime soon.
There are horrific war crimes occurring in Sudan and Syria *right now* and I would be impressed to learn what these ""we will do anything to fight injustice"" activists have had to say about either. Other than to bitterly denounce the grave injustice of whataboutism.
It will never chill out over there.  So which approach will win:

Maslow's hierarchy and pragmatism at a personal level versus the fun of terrorizing a Jewish professor and his wife, trespassing on his property, making a fuss and refusing to leave when asked...again?

Being pragmatic, I'd bet the latter, like 4 times, at least.
not at all. people have been fighting to Palestinians right to survive since the Nakba. we will never ever stop
Other than walking into a professor's back yard with a loudspeaker, being sure to record and upload the video to Twitter, and then rushing to cry ""assault"" after baiting the victims, there's certainly not a lot of showboating.
I'm familiar with it, don't give me attitude. The slandering posters depicted her husband Erwin Chemerinksy, who was hosting the dinner. But I meant to write dean, not prof.
That‚Äôs cool, still on private property
That only applies to places that receive public funding and public places in general. The deans private residence is not being paid for by funding spent on university activities. Ends yet do duty they daisy itself is their choice. If they paid for it out of their own money, they can exclude whoever they want on their own property.
She was absolutely invited, to a student party and as a student, had a right to attend PEACEFULLY. Once she disrupted the party, her rights ENDED.
Sad, but this is the truth. Tragedy is happening throughout the world, but social media frames everyone‚Äôs perception on what matters.
Yup, these NPC‚Äôs haven‚Äôt been programmed to care about issues in those countries.
i‚Äôm dying hahahahahah
Yeah, they're litterally using famine to genocide their own minority population right now.
Explain
>30,000 people dead with a >90% civilian death rate.
So it's not a humanitarian concern, if us stops the funding then no one will give a shit about the genocide? Is that what you are implying?
No you can protest here in Bay Area, block the bay bridge and hold up a sign saying ""stop the Genocide in burma now""
US funds Saudi Arabia whose killed thousands of civilians in Yemen.
Our government absolutely funds the rebel factions in Syria. Jeez.
So it's about your government funding them, if the funding stops and genocide continues you would not give a fuck?
We supply all of Turkey and they‚Äôre a member of NATO while they‚Äôve been genociding the Kurds. Wonder why the leftists and Islamists don‚Äôt care about that
While that's good but I did not see a single protest when it was happening.
The Houthis still exist though, so it's not a good peace. Signing a ceasefire without eliminating the terrorist group is like putting out half of a fire. Just two months ago the Houthis attacked international shipping lanes.
I don't give a fuck! I was just curious why people are picking and choosing a genocide to protest.
The fact that you are getting down voted is astounding. 

""la la la la I don't want to hear the truth""
So Jews have to pass a litmus test of performative outrage before they‚Äôre safe? Huh.
You sound unhinged. The professor even stated they agreed with them. I think you‚Äôre just a Jew hating piece of shit, calling any and all Jew a Zionist unless they pass your loyalty test. You‚Äôre a bigot and a racist.
They may be disruptive. We will see how successful they are. Remember that, for most of these protesters and the groups they are part of, success means getting rid of Israel.
How do you know he‚Äôs staunchly Zionist?
Disagree.  I don‚Äôt even understand ‚Äústaunchly Zionist.‚Äù The word Zionist has been completely weaponized.  The Zionist movement is over, it resulted in the Jewish Palestinians creating a state of their own called Israel. On land the UN ceded to them as part of the British Mandate.  They built a state and now face war after war protecting its citizens . And like in the 6 day war, and wars around the world - if you lose, you lose territory.  So don‚Äôt start wars! Arab Palestinians need to stop whining and get building. Israel and the international community will help. Israel will be obligated to. The word Zionist, claims of genocide - this is Soviet era propaganda that is used over and over again to new generations to keep this conflict alive.  I‚Äôm old, seen it all.  It‚Äôs time for the world to stop coddling the Palestinians. They get more aid than any other nation on earth combined!
So basically, people that one disagrees with have no rights. That's a world i want to live in üëç
She was asked to leave ‚Äú20-30 times‚Äù according to an eyewitness: https://jweekly.com/2024/04/10/this-is-not-your-house-anti-israel-protester-disrupts-berkeley-law-deans-backyard-dinner-refuses-to-leave/
You have to say ‚ÄúZionist.‚Äù That‚Äôs what makes it OK.
Bingo!
They assume the history of Gaza began on October 8th (that's when they started looking).
Not to mention these women protestors will be treated like cattle in Gaza.

Literally rape was legal up til 2019 in that area.
Why do the worst people jump on these actually legitimate problems? So many clips are cut out of context and these twitter accounts have so much bias and stock into being anti-intellectualism, anti-academic, that it‚Äôs really hard to trust anything they post or say. They claim to represent free, independent media, and yet are the opposite of it, and pander to the anti-woke crowd. Like look at this tweet: https://x.com/MythinformedMKE/status/1740147978931954083

I hate all these organizations and people who call themselves ‚Äúinformed‚Äù and ‚Äúradical‚Äù for going against the narrative when they are just pandering to this bigoted crowd, and using legitimate issues to further their own goals and beliefs, instead of trying to fix them.
Also new account, I see you pushing anti-mrna vaccine shit and stupid conspiracies. Further proves the point I guess‚Ä¶
People only have the right to protest on public property.
She had a right to attend the party peacefully as a graduating third year law student. She instead staged a protest with 8 other students, intending to create a ""scene"" and videotape it for TikTok. There are no first amendment rights for that.
it becomes tresspass when they're asked to leave.

  
invitations to private property are not a 'come do whatever you want' -- and in this case the invitation included 'let's make this about the law school'
Which ""cause"" are you referring to? The cause these people are advocating for is not a change in Israeli policy or Palestinian autonomy next to Israel, but for the elimination of Israel permanently. I'm asking only because I feel like a lot of other Jews are going along with the anti-Israel crowd without really knowing what they believe.
Same, actually, on all counts, but I also have a real issue with antisemitism that's masquerading as anti-Zionism.
I don‚Äôt lump most Gazans in with Hamas because they are terrorists. It is hard to outright refute them when you have them everywhere.
People probably don‚Äôt know. They should but it isn‚Äôt something that is common knowledge of all you are looking for is something to protest that is part of the zeitgeist.
Ok r/genzionist poster
What time is being wasted?
True
cuz everyday i am waiting for them to be expelled.
The 1a let's you speak wherever you are, including whilst trespassing, without government intervention. Since they're government employees I assume that's the stance being taken.
Annoying? Did i say annoying? Its sad whats happening over there now just as it was on october 7th. The protestors have been protesting democrat fundraisers etc, how does this help? If trump were to get re elected he would just tell israel to mow it down anyway, so if they really want it mowed down protesting dems is a good way to make it happen, were in our own existential threat inside the US so i tried to support gaza until the protestors became a threat to my nation, and once hamas said it basically killed the 40 hostages it was supposed to have.


Again, the protestors are changing hearts and minds, of the people that used to support gaza, you can see my posts here i was pressing israelis to see it differently, i suggested it could be considered genocide, but now ive made a full 180, there is a threat to my own safety that the protestors create when they go after dems in such a crucial year
No, the annoying protests are just the bleeding edge of the problem. You have no evidence of 10,000 children dying (\*by the same logic you apply to Israeli rape victims) and are accepting Hamas numbers as fact. The ""aid workers"" were Hamas operatives. The journalists were ""fake"" and just more Hamas operatives. The hospitals were literally bases where Hamas hid weapons and stored supplies (thus, they lost their protected status). Oh and 500 miles of terror tunnels built with BILLIONS in foreign aid!

That story about ""twins"" is almost certain fake, like the dolls they pre-ordered and paint up with fake blood & soot so that western fools like you believe all the pro-Hamas propaganda.

ANY civilians who died in Gaza, died as a direct result of Hamas -- who used them as human shields -- who could have built bomb shelters instead of terror tunnels.
https://www.reddit.com/r/BadHasbara/s/Syoacgnb5z saying shit like this makes people think you‚Äôre an antisemite.
>  these people on campus would still be supporting them.

and professors on campus would still be supporting them and teaching their students ""by any means necessary""

Berkeley and so many other universities are so lost.
How about Hamas sympathizers, that better?
She posted several social media posts with literal support of terrorist organizations (including naming them).
And then disinvited
And they were allowed to stay as guests. Once she made herself unwelcome, she was asked to leave. She did not leave immediately, and was forcibly removed as the law allows for folks who trespass.

This isn't hard, you're just being obtuse.
It's unfortunately a larger fraction of them than you'd want to believe - while of course not all and also not inherent that it will remain the case. Integration and indoctrination need to be discussed, even if it is currently socially difficult to do.

I agree that the sentiment is bad and disappointing. It think the answer to your question, though, is that when people spend half a year being hunted and told they‚Äôre genocidal monsters everywhere they turn at school, they tend to lose sight of context a bit. Pretty hard to understand, right?
> The Dean‚Äôs wife grabbing her was also illegal.

If somebody is trespassing on your property and refuses to leave, you have the right to use reasonable force to make them leave.
You literally can though. If it's your house or your private property you can physically remove them. What they gonna do? Call the police? The law backs us up on things like that..
Are Jewish voices actively being silenced? Not to be blunt, but I genuinely don‚Äôt see that happening here. We have to divorce anti-Zionist sentiments, which have ramped up significantly on campus, from anti-semitism, which most good-faith Palestinian activists abhor. Otherwise we‚Äôll be stuck in debate gridlock forever.

What about all of the Jewish voices spearheading the anti-Zionist movement? They‚Äôve been speaking out on Palestinian oppression for years and the right is certainly not listening to them.
This isn't true at all clearly seeing as we are one of the only schools within the UC system that still hasn't divested.... if you are uninformed on what they are protesting about say that!
Religion exists for people. People don‚Äôt exist for religion.
Even if someone does something terrible to you, there are limits to how you can react. This is being too much. 

Anyone who can‚Äôt see that is truly inhuman.
Without this we would not all be talking about it so good on them!
Like that lady that gripped her neck. Ya she got a grip too
They did not barge into the guy‚Äôs house they were invited, can you get your facts straight. Also you all are such hypocrites because you call this a home invasion and how the right to protect and defend your home exists, yet don‚Äôt bat an eye when Israeli settlers kick out Palestinians and destroy their homes. You don‚Äôt support the liberation movement when their communities are absolutely obliterated or their right to defend. How shameful.
This is quite a republican take. You seem to glorify homeowners shooting people.
Way to revive the discussion by saying the same thing 10 people said before you, but thankfully millions of people saw this go viral and are against assaulting students
Because feelings
doubt it...seems like u just made that up
Are we though? it‚Äôs pretty self-explanatory.
I imagine tempers were already high because of the offensive posters about the dinner.
Even if she did, was she still not invited to the event as a representative and to give a speech? You miwa glazers are acting like this was a random student that broke into a private event when she was a representative for her group that was invited
Sure, buddy. Whatever helps you sleep at night. üòÇ
The protests have NOT been antisemitic. There have been ‚Äúguardians‚Äù who sift through the crowd and look for people doing antisemitic shit so that they can kick them out. In fact, a lot of the protesters are Jewish students who are against the apartheid Israeli regime.
So then its okay for h@m@s to be doing that to the Israelis since they're in their home... right?
There is an ongoing genocide happening right now in Palestine perpetrated by Israel and backed by the USA. These are facts. 

Denying and down playing an active, verifiable genocide IS WHAT A FACIST DOES.
Typical lib shit. There‚Äôs no right way to protest. Protect capitalist property. Support Israel‚Äôs genocide.
Where‚Äôs the timestamp? I‚Äôve watched it a couple times over and can‚Äôt find the part where she said she agreed about Palestine
This is absurd. These people are just trying to chase clout and be America‚Äôs next top activist.
My god these people need consequences. Serious consequences. They genuinely think they have a right to do whatever they want on other people's property.
I don‚Äôt hear anything stating ‚Äúwe agree with you about Palestine‚Äù. That‚Äôs a gross MIs quote
Insane or just plain scummy ambulance and fame chasers?
They support Hamas. Not shit they are insane. I‚Äôm certain if you ask her about woman‚Äôs rights she‚Äôd also state she‚Äôs against them, and would like to follow sharia law.
Source?
How is she spreading anti-beliefs? Standing against the most blatant ethnic cleansing since the holocaust is a just cause to be disruptive.
Everything is anti semitic to you people.

Zionists is not a dirty word. prove me wrong. Everybody deserves a Homeland even the Palestinians. It does not mean it‚Äôs a one state solution. Many two state solutions have been offered all were rejected. These people have no shame they should be expelled from school.
one can boycott a slaveholder into not being a slaveholder, but one can‚Äôt boycott a Jew (at least not an ethnic Jew) into not being a Jew.
While calling for a boycott?
Well they can use the phones Palestinians created if they are so afraid of Jews
So why do you think people use it?
You‚Äôre conflating people saying ‚ÄúCriticizing society? Then why do you have an iPhone?‚Äù And people screaming about supporting Israeli divestment while relying and enjoying Israeli made products and technology.
Idk, I used to keep hearing how Intel processors were ""invented in Israel,"" but Apple's got their own chips.
I use my iPhone and many Israeli products!  It‚Äôs a great country!
Ok, but are they going to boycott or not if they are so afraid of Jews?
they are explicitly saying that the law school invests in Israel. is it true or not? after that comes the question whether the dean has any power over it (if he doesn't, who does?), but I'd like to clarify this basic fact first
And then she blatantly lies about what happened in the video to try and make it more likely to be seen as a crime lol
Lying liars lie.  Almost like the whole ""movement"" is a fucking raft of bullshit.
Or even more hilariously now they‚Äôre trying to claim ‚Äúracist white supremacist‚Äù virally on social media platforms about the dean and his wife üôÑ

You absolutely can ‚Äúforce‚Äù someone to leave your property if they refuse to leave when asked.
The second they don't want you there, you're trespassing
People like you have completely exhausted whatever sympathy I have left for these people.

Genocide or not, I legit don't give a shit. I have a life to live, and I'm very busy. 

Cry me a river.
Literally not a genocide.
Most people would not argue that the mass murder of palestinians is just something that's ok to intentionally do. Most people supporting zionism as in the right for Israel to exist don't believe that. Now help liberate the oppressed indigenous americans your government maintains total control over the decision-making of.
admissions are still ""rigorous"" for the most part.
Problem is, law schools know that their graduates will no-life 2 months to pass the bar anyway, so some of them, like Cal and Yale, have decided to stop giving real grades. 

No incentive to take classes seriously until she crams for the bar
This!
>Decision maker... Dean

They are doing a protest. Dean of a law school seems like a reasonable person to aim at, more power on his hands than, what, 99.99% of people?

>Jewish

I don't see any mention of any antisemitic talking points from these protestors? Lots to criticize or get mad at without inventing stuff (and that includes the protestors, who claim islamophobia in their response letter).
I think he did the right thing here and just let it happen. I'm critiquing you, not him lol
What rights are being trampled by the protestors here?
So interestingly enough this isn't like an unanswered question: you don't check your first amendment at the schoolhouse gate.

That said, they're allowed to regulate speech to prevent disruption. This would entail calling police to stop the disruption and charging them appropriately.

But again, if the protestor was not posting a threat, only a law enforcement officer with devolved enforcement authority (which would include school police departments but almost certainly not non-LEO private security) would be able to physically force them off the stage without risk of legal reprisals (assault etc, specifics vary by jurisdiction).

The dean plays it right here just letting it happen while making his objection be clear and known while waiting for the cops. Would have never been an issue if lady hadn't tried to grab her when it wasn't totally clear that was a) necessary or b) legally allowable. Now it's a whole debate lol
literally like we dgaf
Israel is not committing ""genocide"" -- stop using words, if you don't know what they even mean. Syria killed 400,000 of their own citizens in the last few years, 50% were children. All were Muslim. You and the protesters here said nothing and did nothing about that. You certainly were not screaming ""Syrian GENOCIDE!""

The reality is you are only angry because you hate Jews. Also, it feels cool and empowering to accuse the actual victims of a REAL genocide of the same crime... but it isn't true.

The students here staged this event to make a pro-Hamas TikTok.
Eeek. It‚Äôs cool you realize what the protestors did was wrong, yet you‚Äôre still oddly proudly antisemitic.
Just to be clear you're currently engaging in the behavior I'm asking about
I'm a big guy. Not so much worried about safety but the all the antics just seem exhausting
Also considering UC Davis. Undergrad for econ
I'd actually consider myself broadly conservative but I'm generally private about my politics and disinterested in activism. I'll be honest the ultra liberal climate has me a little wary but at the end of the day I'm just there to show up for my diploma.
hAvE YoU StUdIeD AmErIcAn hIsToRy aT AlL? This isn't the 60s and Berkeley has obviously changed as an institute in more ways than one. I'm specifically asking if the current climate around the Israel-Palestine conflict is generally reflective of political tensions on campus in the 21st century.
It‚Äôs ok I mean I loved all the great scientists and people at Cal and if I had the choice I‚Äôd do it here again. But I can‚Äôt say I miss campus right now
It's not so much a punishment or retribution for their behavior.  It's a question as to whether this person is fit to serve as an attorney. The bar runs a very extensive background check and character references matter. I guarantee you the reviewer will be made aware of this event and question Chemerinsky about it. 

From my perspective, I agree that this isn't that big of a deal and shouldn't jeopardize a young career. But Chemerinsky may feel differently. And a negative assessment from a member of the legal community as esteemed as Dean Chemerinsky could be grounds for the Bar to reject an application for licensure.
Watched you huff copium throughout this thread.

Literally, a hijabi was hurt, her breasts were grabbed, can‚Äôt you read?

Edit: fucking /s
The cause is fundamentally extremist (destroy the only minority state in the Middle East) so it makes sense that the tactics and rhetoric are too
""First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; 

""who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; 

""who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; 

""who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; 

""who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" 

""Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."" - MLK
""think"" is what I used to call Adderall. Food for thought :D
Yeah, a private birthday party at someone's home is not a university event in any way the fact that they were Keisha and targeted like this makes it a hate crime.
I'll just boil that down to the core of what you're saying:

""A feud as old as Israel will never end, therefore, harrass local jews""

Certainly doesn't sound like a slippery slope to me.
And in a scale an order of magnitude larger than in gaza
No one was protesting before Oct 7‚Ä¶then all of a sudden it‚Äôs worthy of their attention
Even Hamas admitted taking 6,000 combatant casualties several months ago. A realistic combatant death estimate at this stage is 10,000-15,000. The total 34k deaths reported by Hamas is itself a highly questionable figure, but if we assume 5k of those deaths were natural deaths and Palestinians killed by Hamas (a realistic number), we're looking at civilian deaths rates of 50-60%. Far from ideal, but certainly not nearly as bad as most urban conflicts. This would almost mean a combatant's odds are dying are somewhere around 30-50% whereas a civilian's odds of dying are somewhere around 1%, which is pretty consistent with Israel's claim that they are targeting Hamas.

If the strikes were indiscriminate, the odds of dying as a civilian vs a combatant would be much closer.
Factually incorrect, maybe read more than Al Jazeera :)
can‚Äôt speak to what you think i‚Äôm implying but you can read my comment again to understand what i‚Äôm explicitly saying. or you can continue to straw man if you like that works too.
Is the US government funding the Burmese government? Do the US lawmakers regularly go to Burma and reaffirm their unwavering support for burma's right to genocide their own citizens?
Besides, I just wanted to call out your bullshit argument. What makes you think that we didn't protest Burma, or yemen or China. In the case of Yemen specially, who TF do you think is fighting against it? Buddhist monks?
and i don‚Äôt agree with that? the US itself has directly killed innocent civilians in afghanistan and iraq. the US has also been funding israel for decades yet the outcry is louder now because of the scale of this massacre and blatantly barbaric acts of violence that Israel is openly committing. 
yes the US has been complicit in taking innocent lives, how does that lessen its impact in this ‚Äúwar‚Äù?
of course i would on a human level, but i would feel much more angered and obligated to speak out if my country, my elected representatives, and my own tax dollars were contributing to genocide. either way why does other people‚Äôs activism threaten you unless you don‚Äôt give a fuck about genocide at all?
True but [Dems tried to block weapon sales to Saudi Arabia in the Yemeni civil war but Trump vetoed it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html). Dems did more to hold Saudi Arabia's recklessness accountable than Israel who has been pretty reckless even though they're fighting a justified war against Hamas terrorists.

Far left refusing to vote for Hillary caused this. Obama blocked weapons deals to Saudi Arabia out of some concern to how they were acting in Yemen, and [Trump immediately unblocked those deals](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-state-department-saudi-arabia-arms-sales-yemen-air-strikes-barack-obama-block-weapons-precision-guided-missiles-a7620821.html). I feel like lots of these ridiculous far left pro-Palestinian protesters are going to foolishly withhold their votes for Biden which will undermine their cause if Trump wins. They're wasting their time doing these stupid, counterproductive protests against, and what's even more absurd is that she's ""protesting"" against two highly respected people who have literally criticized many of Israel's policies towards Palestinians! Ludicrous.
They‚Äôre currently still lobbing bombs into Israel daily, they haven‚Äôt gone anywhere.
Excuse me, but Saudi Arabia has killed over 400,000 people in Yemen and the United States sells more weapons to them than any other country. I used to believe that American Hegemony was a disastrous evil because of its treatment of its own marginalized people and the rest of the world. Then I ""heard the truth"" about the human rights records of theocracies like Saudi Arabia and Iran and the personality cults of North Korea and Russia.
Ah yes Iran‚Äôs brutal gender apartheid is the fault of Israel and the US. Tell me, if American neo-colonialism is to blame for religious fanaticism and theocratic regimes, why didn‚Äôt Honduras ever jail and murder women for the crime of not covering their hair?
The user ‚Äúhimsenior‚Äù here. I‚Äôm not engaging with anymore. He is using the human shields myth.

I looked on his comment history, he tried quoting the same thing on the Sam Harris (a well-known Islamophobe) subreddit, was corrected in his quote since Sam Harris was referring to an Iraqi group. He even recognized the correction, and is still trying to spread misinformation because facts don‚Äôt support Israel ofc
They demand of Jews what they don‚Äôt from Muslims
The Palestinians are in far more danger than ‚ÄúJews‚Äù, I‚Äôm sure you meant Israelis. The Palestinians have had their lands taken from them, and there is a humanitarian crisis ongoing in Gaza in case you haven‚Äôt heard.
Zionist is a dogwhistle for ‚ÄúJew.‚Äù The people who use that word as a negative don‚Äôt even know what it actually means. Or they‚Äôve deliberately chosen to steal the language. 

All a Zionist is, is someone who believes Israel has a right to exist. That‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt mean you support the actions of the Israeli government or that you hate Palestinians. Just crazy the amount of ignorance and antisemitism going around right now.
If I was a bigot and racist, then I‚Äôd support the Netanyahu regime and the extermination of Palestinians in Gaza. People like you are ignorant and silently consent.
By what authority did the UN establish a Jewish state? The Jews and Palestinians existed in peace before.
its a Jewish newspaper, of course it biased. Anyways I watched the video and clearly she said ""leave me and the mic and I will leave"" and she did. and It was obvious the discussion was about the assault.

  
and even if there were asked many times to leave, call the cops. she has no right to grab her and grab her hijab. that's assault.
I got banned from another sub for saying that Zionist is clearly a dog whistle for Jews at this point¬†
It should be pretty clear to all now that anti Israel activists denying they are anti-Semitic is like the town drunk insisting he is not an alchoholic.
The other things that account tweeted don't change what happened at Stanford. Here's context that's not from twitter: [https://freebeacon.com/campus/dogshit-federal-judge-decries-disruption-of-his-remarks-by-stanford-law-students-and-calls-for-termination-of-the-stanford-dean-who-joined-the-protesters/](https://freebeacon.com/campus/dogshit-federal-judge-decries-disruption-of-his-remarks-by-stanford-law-students-and-calls-for-termination-of-the-stanford-dean-who-joined-the-protesters/)

>One source of the students‚Äô ire was Duncan‚Äôs refusal, in a 2020 opinion, to use a transgender sex offender‚Äôs preferred pronouns. The Stanford event, which was sponsored by the law school‚Äôs chapter of the Federalist Society, got so out of hand that federal marshals eventually escorted Duncan from the building.  
...  
Nearly everyone in the room showed up to disrupt the proceeding, according to Duncan and two members of the Federalist Society, and many of the hundred or so students on hand were holding profane signs, including one that declared: ""Duncan can‚Äôt find the clit."" Each time Duncan began to speak, the protesters would heckle him with insults, shouting things like ""scumbag!"" and ""you‚Äôre a liar!""  
...  
\[The associate diversity dean\] also expressed sympathy for students who wanted to ""reconsider"" \[the school's\] free speech policies, given the ""harm"" Duncan‚Äôs appearance had caused.

Because mindlessly screeching at and humiliating a judge for causing ""harm"" by using the wrong pronouns is so intellectual and academic. So much for being an ""elite"" school.

I hate all these organizations and people who call themselves ""diverse"" and ""critical thinkers"" for going against the ""status quo"" when they are just ridiculing and shutting down those who hurt their feelings, all while claiming that they are proponents of ""inclusivity"" and ""free speech.""
What I have said or who I am will not change the absolute farce displayed by the upcoming scholars of our ""elite"" law schools.

The first half of your statement is a blatant lie. There‚Äôs swathes of antizionists who simply want Israel to stick to formerly agreed to borders and end apartheid practices over the Palestinian population. There‚Äôs a large range of opinions in that movement, and framing them all as one big antisemitic group is frankly just a bit disingenuous, especially considering there‚Äôs a large contingent of Jewish antizionists
Can't disagree.

 Really, really difficult to see a path forward which respects all peoples as both sides include extreme zealots who make serious solution-finding decisions (or discussions!) nearly impossible.
Hamas literally does not distinguish between non-fighters just people in Gaza and Hamas fighters when they put out alleged ""numbers"" of casualties of civilians. Also there is clear evidence of how non-fighters helped to kidnap and hold hostages on October 7th. Clearly international law of war is a thing but it's not Israel's fault. Hamas started a war knowing what would result, recruiting people, and using human shields at every opportunity.

You‚Äôre wasting your time being outraged on Reddit instead of working hard to be a person that can actually make a significant difference on the issues you truly care about about and you‚Äôre doing it for people who genuinely don‚Äôt matter (other redditors or people on social media who are also wasting their time)
Debating BS when all of you people on Reddit have 0 world impact. Like Breh, you think world leaders and actual important people are scouring on Reddit trying to disagree with strangers on their opinion on some matter they have no control over ????? Wake up. Get a job or get a hobby.
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not even remotely what the 1a says. Like not at all. There‚Äôs an entire branch of constitutional doctrine dedicated to types of ‚Äúforums‚Äù - literally locations where free speech rights are and are not protected.
There are tons of Jewish dudes with regular beards and there are tons of goys with neckbeards.  This particular person is a terrible person, not because of the beard or their religion.
Yea there's liberalism and then there's liberalism and supporting a group of people that don't even want western ideals?   


So many people were complaining about Shewchuk but I guess supporting Palestine and their total lack of respect for abortion rights and womens rights in general is fine.
That commenter isn't being obtuse. They're correctly stating that the commenter they're responding to was wrong in saying they were uninvited.
Lmfao the original commenter said they were not invited. They were invited. They are law students who received the invitations. I‚Äôm making a correction.
I‚Äôm specifically referencing what you wrote about Chemerinsky and antisemitism. Many Jews who are openly critical of Israel also feel deeply uncomfortable with some of the antisemitic language and tropes that have been invoked in the past 6 months as people have criticized the state. I would assume that is where he comes down, not trying to falsely claim any criticism at all is antisemitism.
Why should I care about your opinion ?
You‚Äôre wasting your time being outraged on Reddit instead of working hard to be a person that can actually make a significant difference on the issues you truly care about about and you‚Äôre doing it for people who genuinely don‚Äôt matter (other redditors or people on social media who are also wasting their time)
Not if that same person who did something terrible to you says they‚Äôre going to do it again and again until you‚Äôre gone. What reaction do you give then?
Define terrible in that context bc terrible could mean a lot of things. If someone is attacking you with intent to do great harm you can cancel their subscription to breathing. 

Not that that's what happened at the party although the homeowner would be justified from physically removing them from his house by force if he had to or needed to. I was just going off your statement of 

>Even if someone does something terrible to you, there are limits to how you can react. This is being too much. 


Furthermore your right to free speech ends when you are on private property or in a private home. You can be asked to leave at any time and you are lawfully obligated to leave.
Yeah we are talking about the students and how stupid they are lol
once they were asked to leave, it was trespass. i sure hope you're not a law student.
The protesters that support Hamas are barging in to someone‚Äôs home. Oh my God, who would‚Äôve thought.
Cool story bro, you still don't have the right to free speech in someone's private home. Invited or not. Invitation can be revoked at any time and if you don't leave homeowner can physically remove you themselves or get the state backed authority to do it. Law is not on her side at all on this
This.
Lmao you don‚Äôt have to be Republican to be pro second amendment. Especially when it‚Äôs trespassing..
That's fair, but he's correct though. In Texas homeowner would be able to shoot.  Even still homeowner has the right to demand they leave and if they don't he can physically remove them by grabbing them (hopefully as gently as possible) and put them out. You have that right as a homeowner. It's not something most people fantasize about or want to do though. Most if not all people want a peaceful resolution but most are also prepared to use force if necessary to get people to leave their home.  

Lesson to take away from all this, if someone ask you to leave, just leave don't cause a scene and you are lawfully obligated to leave once asked anyway so just follow the law. Or the law will be used against you.
Removing someone from your private home is not ""assaulting students"". Where do you get that idea from? If someone ask you to leave their home, you HAVE to leave. You don't get a say in that matter. If you don't, the homeowner is legally and lawfully protected if they decide to push you out. As a law student she (and others like her and agreeing with her, including those millions) you just talked about should know that.
*the antisemitic posters about her husband. 

Fixed it for you
What were the posters? The sense I get is that a lot of the accusations of antisemitism tend to be massively misconstrued instances of anti-israeli-regime sentiment; which are reasonable because netanyahu is an authoritarian lunatic who was literally experiencing weekly protests from israels for trying to undermine their independent judiciary before he launched his offenses on Gaza.  Either way, I am also Jewish and have no issue stepping back from my own reactions to any potentially antisemitic sentiment to recognize that it is clearly palestinians that are being systematically killed right now and are most-deserving of my outrage and protection in whatever ways I can support them.
No everyone was invited on the condition they wouldn't disrupt the event. Which she did
she was invited to celebrate 3L, not to disrupt the event due to the dean being jewish.
OK.  I'm going to go in your bedroom and protest. I dont care if it keeps you up all night. I don't care if you need to go to work. I will keep going into my demands are met. You said it was ok so I'm not trespassing.
You're being willfully ignorant if you think there hasn't been antisemitic events going on. The governor of New York doesn't hold press conferences explicitly calling out protestors targeting Jewish students for no reason.
Newp. Stop with the magical thinking that those losers are anything more than 12th century tribes banded together to fight a common enemy. If Israel didn‚Äôt exist, they‚Äôd be fighting and killing each other.¬† If you can‚Äôt be civilized, stay the fuck home. Don‚Äôt go and ruin a function that somebody put together to be nice. Buncha fucking nut jobs.¬†
War and proyesting on someone's private property agent the same thing. Hamas does not own palestine as their own private property.
Isupport a mutual s much as anyone else but By the actual definition of genocide that's debatable. Eben if that were the case that doesn't mean people who disagree with you in the slightest but dont support genocide deserve to have their right taken away. The fan never said the deaths of palestinian civilians was a good thing. Civlians being collateral in a war doesn't equal genocide.

being a zionist who supports the right of israel to exist and nothing more does not equal supporting genocide.  All zionism means is the right for israel to exist. Always has meant this. 

Even for the most horrible people, their rights are not taken away until given a fair trial, and they are innocent until proven guilty. Otherwise, you are just arguing for vigilantism, which is a very fascist form of justice due to making onself judge jury and executioner.
the right way to protest is the one that achieves your goals. looking like a dick does not achieve your goals, so it's the wrong way to protest.
Do people just toss around political buzz words nowadays and pretend they mean something? Talk about brain rot.
I can‚Äôt figure out how to get the time stamp on the Xitter platform, but it‚Äôs about 3/4 of the way through. The comment I replied to paraphrased. Fisk says she agrees with them that what‚Äôs happening is terrible around the same time as the Dean is explaining to the other protester how the law school isn‚Äôt in charge of Berkeley investments, so the camera‚Äôs moving around a bit. 

To be fair, the agreement on the war being terrible is obscured by the Dean explaining how university investing works. It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôve got an audio confirmation bias on that one. I was referring to the investment part, cuz that was more shocking to me‚Äîwhich classes did these students take??
Narcissistic bigots. They picked the first big school event hosted by Jews they could find. Fucking disgusting.
And then turn it into some anti bias bullshit.
It‚Äôs Berkeley, California there are no consequences.
As I said elsewhere, best we can hope for is that the other Palestinian-American student groups publicly denounce this one group. It's actually important to their cause that they clamp down on this.
Hmmmmmmmm‚Ä¶ - Native America
Isn‚Äôt she a Berkeley law student that was invited to that dinner?
Yes the woman who physically grabbed the student, as shown in the pictures here, should certainly face consequences. Violence is never an acceptable response to someone saying words you don‚Äôt like. Even if they are guests in your home. 

If Ms. Fisk had remained calm and called the police she could stand on the high moral ground.  Instead she lost her temper and physically assaulted this student.
Serious consequences LOL. Clutching your purse.
From the law student perspective, the divestment conversation mentioned by the original commenter, that‚Äôs happening at the same time as the Fisk convo where she seems to have said that, is far more interesting. That‚Äôs why the video‚Äôs focus and my focus is on the Dean. The protesters didn‚Äôt understand that the law school Dean had nothing to do with the university‚Äôs investments. This was racially targeted.
‚ÄúWe agree with you about what‚Äôs going on in Palestine,‚Äù Fisk says in a separate video as Afaneh and students leave.

‚ÄúThen what have you done about divestment? Nothing. Nothing,‚Äù a different student says as she walks away.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt control the investment,‚Äù Fisk replies.

Porque no los dos?
Future lawyers
Me when I believe American lies.
Really?  Serbia, Rwanda, Sudan, Yemen, and the Uighurs would like a word. Gazans are not an ethnicity. If you think there is a cleansing and not a war then what is life like in Ramallah or Nablus like right now?
It‚Äôs really not, and the false invocation of the Holocaust in this context is ridiculous. It only gets brought up as an example of ‚Äúlook who‚Äôs now the perpetrators‚Äù which is in extremely bad faith and considered an example of antisemitism under the IHRA definition. There are many examples of intended ethnic cleansing and genocide since the Holocaust at magnitudes of scale from this as well as completely different in context. I‚Äôm not really understanding where you and others are getting this idea from
You can say Jews. We know what ‚Äúyou people‚Äù means, bigot.
At his home, private residence. They all could and perhaps should  have been arrested for trespassing. What gives her the right?
Yep if you‚Äôre a genocidal rape supporting anti semite that has zero clue of the law and claim sexual assault falsely you deserve to be named and shamed.

She brought this on herself
Everybody deserves an ethnostate? Where do we all claim ours? What if we don't want one? Where do we get to live when all the ethnostates are divvied out?
May I remind you that 2 million israeli Arabs, Christians and bedouins live in Israel? Israel is home to many ethnicities. Notice that the two million Arabs in israel are supportive of the war against Hamas? They‚Äôre not stupid.
You are equating being Jewish with condoning the genocide that is currently happening in Gaza.
that won't stop these clowns from trying
I don't dispute your claims about the set of people who boycott a product and those they target with that boycott.

I am, however, explicitly making a claim about that set's negation: those who *choose not to boycott* a product. Someone who *chooses not to boycott* a phone that is made possible by a group they morally disagree with applies to both those who oppose Israelis and those who oppose slaveholders *on the basis that such beings are enriched by the purchase*. 

This still holds true if people other than those individuals *still* boycott phones. I'm not in a morally less compromised position for buying that phone if you choose to boycott it, *even if we agree or disagree that slaveholders are bad*.
The intent of the BDS movement is not related to all Jews, or stopping Israelis from existing, or stopping people from practicing Judaism. The intent is to get the state of Israel to end certain policies that oppress Palestinians. So the purpose of the BDS movement is similar to your example of boycotting a slaveholder into not being a slaveholder. Just like the successful boycott movement against Apartheid South Africa, which did not call for or cause White South Africans to be eradicated from South Africa or Earth.
Yes, because *calling for a boycott* and *doing a boycott* are not the same actions; one can and will continue to do both. We're welcome to call that inconsistent, but once again:

People who simultaneously calls to *abstain from slave-produced* products while buying slave-produced phones is in the same moral quandry as someone who simultaneously calls to *abstain from Israeli-produced products* while buying Israeli-produced phones.

The only way for *either person* here to resolve the departure between rhetoric and action is to either stop buying the phone or to stop calling for a boycott.
That is orthogonal and, as far as I'm aware, not actually a possibility. An impossible task is not an ethics one may possibly adopt. It still seems the fact that a person with anti-israel views is not in a morally more compromising situation than a person with positions against slavery with respect to phone purchase, for they are both relying on actors they ethically disagree should exist to obtain such.
Because it is good at making superficially witty statements that will convince people.
That is the same argument, except that it‚Äôs even more diluted because the products aren‚Äôt israeli made at all, Apple likely sourced some product from there or have some patents from Israeli people or companies they own but it‚Äôs disingenuous for people to say that it is critical to the iPhone and hypocritical, they are literally mainly made in China and designed in the US, and all the patents are in the US, not Israel. Buying an Israeli company to use their technology isn‚Äôt really a gotcha against people supporting Palestine lol
jewish people are some of the greatest in history!
The short answer is ""No the dean does not have any power over investments"". The long answer is that your question is hard to answer because there seems to be a misunderstanding. The law school doesn't invest in anything but it's law students. It's not a private school, it's a part of the  UC system.

As the other commenter already mentioned they're talking about the UC's money. These are things like the UC endowments and other UC money like retirement funds, etc. How much of that money is invested in Israeli companies. I have no idea. But for the sake of illustration let's assume there is some amount in Israeli companies.

This money is managed by UC Investments, which are headed by the chief investment officer who reports to the UC President and the Regents. I'm gonna assume you know who they are. Furthermore I'm not sure if even a majority of regents wanted divestments they could direct the CIO to do it. If the president and the regents wanted it, they probably could but I've never heard of such a process. If the CIO tried to do it unilaterally, it might be seen as violating his fiduciary responsibility and even then I'm not sure if it'd be legal. Last I heard, the CIO is Jagdeep Bachher iirc. 
 
If you want more information just google UC Investments and go to their website. They should have reports totalling their various investments and the current CIO.

TLDR: the protestors were asking the wrong people for something that is legally fraught and would be slow moving and complicated.
No their complaint is about the UC's relationship with some corporations (unclear which ones) that support Israel. Their actual message wasn't clear lol. The point is one guy doesn't have control over an entire university, it's not a monarchy, plus they said they agree with them about what's happening in Palestine.

There is likely a board that controls investments, it's never gonna be just one guy.
Why are so many people upset at this question? I think because none of them know the answer.
What part isn‚Äôt?!
Their actions were a little bit out of line but you've got to admit that killing children is wrong and a cease-fire would stop it
Their home, doing an annual event associated with the school. No different than at a restaurant etc.

And no you can't force someone to leave... You trespass them and cops can remove them.
No you really can't. Of they aren't a threat to you (enabling self defence with reasonable force) then you have to call the cops. That's why cops have to do evictions etc.
I mean they have to communicate that but yeah. And they need to call cops to get them out. Dude in video is perfect only the wife loses her cool
You‚Äôre so cool for not caring about genocide!
‚Äúthe deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group‚Äù how is it not a genocide?
[deleted]
lol thinking Berkeley law admissions don‚Äôt involve affirmative action and extra brownie points to DEI causes good one
So why protest this person at this event?  I disagree that it is a public event and I don‚Äôt believe a person should be able to Kanye the mic at a private function (even if they were invited). There is no connection between this dinnner and Gaza at all. So what is the protest directed toward?
>they're allowed to regulate speech to prevent disruption.

Yes, this is exactly what happened. Then the homeowner took reasonable steps to remove a trespasser from their property. The suggestion that only a police officer can intervene is nonsense. The homeowners acted within their rights in this instance and hired private security to act as their agents on subsequent nights.
Which line is antisemitism?
Looool ok if you expect people to have 0 opinions then Berkeley is prob not the place for you. There's a distinction between being loudly wrong vs. correcting people who are.
You'll be fine.
I can't tell you what to do (except, be sure to take lot of coding and math classes!), but you might want to check out the ucdavis subreddit. Threads like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1c0xzp6/has_anyone_chosen_davis_over_berkeley/).
Berkley is and always has been a hotbed of heated political discourse. There were literally people in trees protesting the destructive of a park. Pick your conflict. Students will be protesting at Berkley more than anywhere else.
To answer your question: no. Most people in the country don't care, which is why it's so easy for israel to do a genocide. And the ones that do care mostly care because they think being Jewish is equivalent to supporting the state of Israel and so they think they are being attacked, 'never again,' rah rah rah.
Id argue it would diminish him in the eyes of the bar. That said I see no indication he's looking at that, and he handled the whole situation extremely well imo. Would have been perfect if his wife had just chilled out lol
Unlike the lies spread about Gaza, here everyone saw the video and nobody believes your lies and propaganda.
Yeah lady should not have gotten physical, that's some day 1 stuff lol
This essay gets quoted every single time someone does some jackassery in the name of politics. It's called MLK Syndrome, a disorder where people are so self-important about their cause du jour that they think they are literally MLK.
I guess I have to use /sarc even on r/berkeley.  

Sad.
""no one"". You must have your eyes closed. People have seen (and protested) Israel for what it is since its inception. Go back under your rock and don't pretend you know what you're talking about.
[deleted]
Oh fuck wait you are right, the death toll is more than 30,000 people in gaza since october 2023. Also a number of US dead troops because of Red Sea security problems resultant of netanyahu's idiot policies. But you know more than me and I'm a crazy blue-haired leftist mainlining tiktok videos, right?
The US is a belligerent to the Yemen conflict though?
So it's not a humanitarian concern... it's just because the US government is supporting it. If the US stops all aids to Israel and then, let's say, the UK or China supports Israel and funds them, would all the protests and bullshit here would stop? These individuals would cease the protests and wouldn't care about the genocide any longer?
So it‚Äôs just the money? If the funding stopped you stop being belligerent? You‚Äôd stop yelling ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù at every single event whether a democratic political victory or liberal professor‚Äôs house?

Cause you sure as hell don‚Äôt try this shit at republican political events and rallies. That‚Äôs for sure. Ask yourself.  Why is that? It‚Äôs because this bullshit only works when you‚Äôre given a soapbox. It‚Äôs grandstanding. You‚Äôre fucking vapid.


It only works when you can grab a mic and then scream ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being assaulted‚Äù when it‚Äôs taken away.
US gave arms to Saudi Arabia used to strike Yemen and still resoundingly supports SA. Why did nobody protest that?
So if the US started supporting the rebels in Myanmar who are being slaughtered by the military junta, then you would protest about it? 

I somehow find that highly unlikely.
And no one is denying that. What you are saying is ""I used to care about the evil perpetuated by my country, but then when I turned 12 and learned there are even WORSE places,I was freed from the burden of caring."" 

Yes, obviously, as literally everyone who isn't a child knows, saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, etc do despicable things systematically and in greater numbers than the U.S. This does not mean that Israel is not commiting sanctioned genocide in their open-air prison,bombing aid workers on routes they themselves established. This does not invalidate the previous comment. 

People can care about more than 1 thing at a time.
Saudi Arabia and Yemen have had a truce since 2022, and a more permanent ceasefire since this past December. Maybe you should actually learn about certain topics you‚Äôre commenting on.   

Palestinian-Americans have also been protesting our support for the Saudi regime beforehand. 

Your ‚Äú400,000‚Äù figure includes starvation. The numbers are 150,000. Since 2014. Which is awful, but still doesn‚Äôt dispute anything I stated.
The human shields in Gaza are the civilian population that Hamas placed between themselves underground and Israel‚Äôs bombs. 

The human shield I was referring to in the Harris sub referred to the Iraqi jihadist placing the barrel of his gun on the shoulder of a child.  But you knew that already.
Yes, I have seen Hamas take aid trucks by force, I‚Äôve seen them take aid that should be free to Palestinians and sell it.  Remember that Hamas‚Äô goal is to create so much suffering for their own people that the international community forces Israel to stop fighting. They have been doing this for more than 2 decades - since taking office.  Arafat started this type of ‚Äúresistance‚Äù.  If you listen to what the PLO leaders say, their goal is to martyr their people and keep Israel from normalizing relations with arab states. This has been going on for decades.  

In terms of land stealing - no.  Complete bs.  Immigrant Jews bought land in the 1900s.   I‚Äôm not talking about the illegal settlements in Judea and Samaria. The pro Pali crowd conflates Gaza with Judea and Samaria to confuse the uneducated.
Suggesting the Dean of a California college department should make a public statement decrying a war in another country he isn‚Äôt a citizen of before he‚Äôs worthy of not being harassed is not acceptable.
For which Hamas also bears some responsibility
Regardless, they are not being endangered by a private party that has zero impact on their lives.
Hamas is not bigoted? Come on, little man.
There are left wing zionists in israel that oppose netanyahu and his policies. Zionism didn't mean you support netanyahu or the kahanism he argues for.
Uh - no, they did not.  Look, I‚Äôm happy to share the history I know but not if you‚Äôre here to share the pro Pali propaganda because I get too much of that on other social channels. 

There is a great book by Jorge Garcia Granados called The Birth of Israel - he was on the original UN committee to deal with the British Mandate of Palestine.  An objective observer from Guatemala.  The UN sent a committee to deal with the fact that The Brits failed both Jews and Arabs.  This was the time of British decolonization- so creating a Jewish state after the holocaust was a decolonization effort. the Arabs never were peaceful to the Jews.  Complete inversion of truth.  There are so many sources for this that I cannot name them all, but the book I mention above is great.  I will GIFT it to you if you want.
Bull. There were decades of violence preceding 1948.
Zionism simply means supporting the right of israel to exist. So then, what reason do people have a right to abuse that person of supporting genocide and protesting them. They aren't gaming anyone. They're just simply existing being jewish.
It's ""a Jew's newspaper""?? Jew-hating much?
It absolutely is.
Yes, it was and is David Duke's favorite dogwhistle for Jewish people. He has others of course, but that's #1.
At this point I'm avoiding the term altogether. If you're Jewish, you're Jewish. If you support Israel, you're pro-genocide. They don't have anything to do with each other.
What word would you use to describe ‚Äúunwanted and asked to leave from private property‚Äù?
Legally, the term is trespass. The moment an owner or their representative tells you to leave private property, you are trespassing.
Let's call it ""accepting an invite to a party under false pretenses, with a premeditated plan to disrupt the event, and then refusing to leave when asked"".
They hijacked the event. I get what you are saying-- I had that incorrect assumption as well. However, what they did was still wrong.
If they‚Äôre asked to leave and they don‚Äôt then it‚Äôs trespassing¬†
An anti-Zionist is by definition someone who wants Israel to stop existing. Anti-Zionists want to destroy Israel. 

There is a massive difference between people who criticize Israel because they want better peace and security for Israelis and people who want to wipe Israel off the map. I take great care to separate those groups.

Israel doesn't have formerly agreed to borders. That's like one of the first things people learn about this conflict. There has never been any treaty or otherwise binding agreement to resolve Israel's final borders. The Green Line is a temporary armistice line that is very explicitly not a border and the Israel-Jordan peace treaty only specified an ""administrative line"" along the Jordan River, not a legal border. All proposals by Israel to define a border and create a Palestinian state have been rejected by the Palestinians without counteroffers.

The apartheid libel has already been argued to death, but in summary the apartheid narrative was manufactures by NGOs by completely erasing the historical and legal context, playing around with statistics, ignoring the legal status of Israeli-Arabs, and cherry picking specific areas of inequality while ignoring the fact that Israel's Arab population is literally the best treated Arab population in the Middle East. I have read the Amnesty report and don't see how it could hold water with anyone who is legitimately familiar with the conflict. If I used Amnesty's tactics, I could probably produce an apartheid report against any minority group in any country.
Zionism is about supporting the right for Israel to exist. It is not a statement for ot against genocide or for or against left or right wing politics. So there's no lie. Pro palestine protestors need to stop stretching very important conceptual words that need to be fefined a very specific way instead of changing their original meaning if they want to be taken seriously. It's basically gaslighting.
All of that is true but most Gazans would rather not be under Hamas‚Äôs constant threat while at the same time would like some legitimacy autonomy. It is complicated and very complex.
Yet, you are on here commenting about other people commenting.
The super limited places free speech is not protected. Which this... Simply isn't?
I have zero idea how hiring works in the humanities and social sciences but I do wonder if the key to getting hired now is to be an edge-lord and express ever more radical ideas.

And I'm very cynical and just don't believe academics when they say that their outrageous views on twitter are nothing like how they are in campus and that they respect all well-argued views in their classroom and aren't trying to shove a specific viewpoint into their students.
One law student made herself unwelcome and was asked to leave. She didn't, thereby trespassing private property. She was removed in a gentle manner, her hysteria notwithstanding.
Oh absolutely, I don‚Äôt mean to minimize the harm that things like the dinner poster have caused. Most people I‚Äôve talked to have agreed that both the poster, and the Dean and Prof. Fisk‚Äôs ‚Äòhands-on‚Äô response to a peaceful protest at a university-sponsored event, were in bad taste and caused harm. But these are influential people in positions of power, they have to be willing to accept criticism and hear dissenting opinions, even when bad-faith actors muddy the waters with ugly rhetoric or imagery.
Okay boo have a nice day!
Interesting take seeing as you're in the comments as well
Smear all students wow Berkeley is all UC and nothing else
Read my detailed responses to the 10 people who said the same misrep. This was Berkeley law event
It was him with a bloody fork and knife. Still want to say this is just us being sensitive?
If you haven‚Äôt seen the posters you haven‚Äôt done enough research into what happened here. If you simply google UC Berkeley dinner poster, you can see it.
You sound like a colonial apartheid dictator who used to think the same of native Americans when the British and French came along, lol.

Wait, I really don't think any one should be replying to you since you're not in a mood for discussion, which is apparent by your rude, and disgusting behavior, and two, you really need to touch up on history. But I'll just shown how ignorant you are anyways.

Palestinians are native to the land, which was called palestine or falasteen/ as shaam in Arabic
https://www.un.org/en/situation-in-occupied-palestine-and-israel/history

During the 25 years of the Palestine Mandate, from 1922 to 1947, large-scale Jewish immigration from abroad, mainly from Eastern Europe took place, the numbers swelling in the 1930s with the notorious Nazi persecution of Jewry.
These people were from Europe. White, blue eyed etc.
https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-202927/#:~:text=During%20the%2025%20years%20of,notorious%20Nazi%20persecution%20of%20Jewry.

Even Jewish scholars such as Avi shlaim say that "" Britain had no moral or political or legal right to promise the land that belonged to the Arabs to another people""
https://remix.aljazeera.com/aje/PalestineRemix/phone/al-nakba.html

Ever since the founding of the Zionist movement,[1] supporters of Zionism have downplayed the fact that historic Palestine had always had a healthy indigenous population.  As early as the 19th and early 20th century,[2] Zionists and their supporters repeated the myth widely: ‚ÄúA land without a people, for a people without a land.‚Äù  While this slogan encouraged Jewish emigration to historic Palestine, it also paved the way for one of the largest dispossessions of an ethnic group in modern history.

You really need to stop watching CNN and fox and read on real history
For what I‚Äôm starting to realize as of lately. Yes. I blame the algorithms.
that TV show would really suck, but now i'm curious who would be the host of it?
That is not what happened.
Can confirm, grew up there
No consequences go both ways.  Protests bring about no consequence either.

TBH these protests only serve to sooth the egos of the protesters.  They feel like they need to do something, but really don‚Äôt have a clue what would be effective.
What about if you ""misgender"" someone while wearing a MAGA hat, carrying a bible, and eating meat?
They've already defended it as has CAIR and the national lawyers guild. These groups broadly and genuinely believe they have a right to do whatever they want
‚ÄòErwin Chemerinsky, the law school dean, hosted the dinner on Tuesday night in the backyard of his Oakland, Calif., home. The party was supposed to be a community building event, open to all third-year law students. Mr. Chemerinsky said the dinner was paid for by the university.‚Äô. She was invited to that event. I see all the commenters here just randomly forgot to add such fact üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Once they were told to leave the dean‚Äôs **private** residence and they did not (clutch your purse), they became criminals trespassing.  This is not a ‚Äòfree speech‚Äô protest, this is stupidity and arrogance.
Yep heard the remark that ‚ÄúI‚Äù don‚Äôt have anything to do with UC investments and spending. But that‚Äôs not what above poster stated
So because other stuff is happening or has happened we should just ignore Israel's crimes?
Loooool at your argument, ‚Äúnot denying it‚Äôs ethnic cleansing just that it isn‚Äôt the worst one since the holocaust‚Äùü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Tbh don‚Äôt care what the IHRA says or any other organization says for that matter, it‚Äôs repulsive what Israel is doing. I brought up the holocaust as an example because it‚Äôs the most disgusting act of ethnic cleansing in modern history. Turning up graves to spread disease, bombing locations they instructed civilians to go to, shutting off the water supply, bombing aid convoys, and SHOOTING ISRAELI HOSTAGES HOLDING A WHITE FLAG. All evidence they just want to solve an issue they created by eliminating the demographic.
Wow. Tone deaf af. The meaning behind calling this holocaust like is that Israel is wiping a population from existence simply because they think the land is the right of Israel. Also want to take a moment to call out all religions as toxic control systems that do anything but make the world better.
Zionists. Point proven. LOL your post history is calling everyone antisemitic
This is a clear case of fuck around and find out.¬†
Why would anyone hire this maniac, even if she passed the bar? ¬†She is a headache no one needs.¬†
quite literally the basis of the UN charter is that every nation has the right to self-determination. which is also the fundamental idea behind the two-state solution, that both Israelis and Palestinians should be allowed to exercise that right.

Israel is as much of an ""ethnostate"" as Iraq which over the last 40 years expelled >99% of their Jewish population such that they went from 2% of the population to less than 0.001% to create a >99% Muslim ethnostate.

If anything Israel is less of an ethnostate because they maintain a \~20% non-Jewish population.

if you are American, then you get to live in America. that's your ""ethnostate"" I guess. tbh considering the population reduction in Native Americans over time I'd say that is more of an ethnostate than Israel according to your definition
You assume there is a consensus its genocide, which there is not.
What code of ethics are antisemites going by?
oh yeah but clearly nothing happened in china with Uyghurs Muslims, so it's completely okay.

apple also has two RnD offices in Isreal, one of which they're expanding. (So yes these RnD offices are critical)
Nobody better
thanks, this is helpful, but I'm still unsure. so the law school itself does not invest its funds, it all goes into the collective UC fund? that seems hard to believe, what about all the law school specific donations? do they go in the same bucket as everything else?
sure, no one person has total authority over anything, but that is by itself not a reason to never protest against individuals. does the law school invest in Israel? where can one find this info?
Absolutely, I agree.  Hamas should stop embedding in schools, hospitals, and camps and instead sign a cease fire and support the normalization of Israeli/Arab relations.
Hamas murdered children on 10/7, something that always gets forgotten. They are still holding children, women, old people as hostages RIGHT THIS MINUTE.

Every child who died in Gaza, died at the hands of Hamas which uses children as human shields. Hamas could have protected every Gazan child in their 500 miles of tunnels... but they did not.
You can remove someone from a restaurant for making a scene too, even if a restaurant is a place of public accommodation, which this professor‚Äôs private home was not.
Absolutely, not true. Private property.
Uh what? What would evictions from a place you live and stopped paying rent for or whatever have to do with trespassing on someone else‚Äôs property? 

That is just not true at all. Like yeah you can‚Äôt just shoot someone the second the refuse to leave but you absolutely have the legal right to try to ‚Äúforce‚Äù trespassers to leave your property. You think the cops would arrest you for shoving someone out your door if they were refusing to leave?
Hope you aren‚Äôt at UCBs law school.
They do not need to call the police in California. They may use reasonable force to eject the person. https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3475/
That's not a river. Try harder.
These people will be public defenders
They've been protesting lots of events is my understanding. The protest had an audience of students and faculty/admin, plus look at all these articles now. Seems like a good pick for a nice calm low key speech.

>Kanye the mic

I mean people have lots of rights, including being loud when you don't want them to be. Government associated events (which this likely is covered by) have a lot of loop holes like that.

That said the issue is just they didn't wait for the cops to evict them; can't lay hands on someone who isn't a threat to you like that.
>only police can intervene is nonsense

Hey man, I didn't make the law.

But it's pretty consistent with ""you can't just, like, fuck people up for no reason, even if they're like, super annoying"" principle passed down to us from common law lol
Propagating the lie that Israel is committing genocide is antisemitism. 

Hamas - a terrorist orgniazaiton - revised its made up death toll downwards this week to 22,000, 12,000 combatants and 10,000 civilians. Now that‚Äôs still an exaggerated and made up number but assuming it‚Äôs true that is MORE THAN one combatant dead for every civilian. The average war in modern history is 9 civilians dead for every combatant. But go ahead and continue to falsely claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù because you hate Jews and think Israel doesn‚Äôt have the right to defend itself against terrorism.
Totally agree! In another thread I commented that it was unfortunate for Professor Fisk and I got down voted to hell for supporting the protesters. I certainly don't support them, but the viral images are what they are. And they are unfortunate.
Poe‚Äôs Law üò≠
""essay"" lol. I'm just quoting him, dawg. If you feel called out, that's your own issue.
In my defense, this may be more representative of just how insane the people you were parodying are
How anyone couldn't tell that was sarcasm is beyond me - they never say the second part in English
They've done a lot more then protest too. Hence why Gaza is in the ""find out"" stage of the FAFO matrix.¬†
Why haven't you been so aware of sudan in the same way?
Oh god I hope not. Russia's gonna kick our ass if that's true.
Yikes man you sound like a great analyst
A bad one
90% civilian death is straight up blood libel, estimates are that over 10,000 combatants were killed, which makes this a very typical urban war in terms of combatant vs civilian deaths.
Your estimates are wrong even if we take every Hamas figure at face value.
Actually if us stops aid to Israel then it‚Äôd need to stop aid to Egypt. You‚Äôd then see Egypt enter a civil war and > 100k people be killed with Arab on Arab violence. Similar to the Syrian civil wars death toll (>580k)
Israel is fighting a war against religious fascists, the same kind of fascists who penalize the expression of sexual and gender identity. The religious fascists are committed to martyrdom and paradise. Which explains why they're willing to use their own civilians as human shields. There was a ceasefire on October 6th. Hamas violated it and is culpable for each loss of life on both sides. If performance artists cared, they'd call for Palestinians to rise up against the oppressors who criminalize homosexuality and treat women as second class citizens.

This won't happen because performance artists care about more than one thing at a time to the degree that it maps to their racial, sexual, or gender identity, considered paramount in their fight against the oppression of American capitalism and its surrogates (white, heteronormative, male, cis, etc). If an injustice doesn't relate to that paradigm, performance artists couldn't give two fucks. It's a convenient way to insulate oneself from complex problems while still feeling politically enlightened.
Idk if you‚Äôre new here, but Reddit is full of anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Go to the ‚Äúworld news‚Äù subreddit, say anything remotely pro-Palestine. You‚Äôll get banned lol.

Lotsa Hasbara accounts as well.
Also, Iran definitely doesn‚Äôt do bad things in greater numbers or even close to it than the US. 

We fucked up Honduras because they were unionizing and US has factories there (see San Pedro Sule). And this was light for us. 

Iran is a difficult place to govern because there are powers (US) trying to destabilize it all while there are so many different ethnic groups inside who want a sovereign stare for themselves. 
On the international level, they‚Äôre criticized for funding terror groups‚Ä¶ but those ‚Äúterror‚Äù groups defend against maniacs we already recognized as awful. Like Saudi Arabia and Israel. Meanwhile, US and Israel supported ISIS in Syria, and Al Qaeda (even after Bin Laden‚Äôs death)
The point is the performance artists do not act morally outraged over Saudi Arabia. In all likelihood they didn‚Äôt know it was happening.
As if Hamas could somehow fight back against US-backed Israel?  Sounds like you are the one consuming the propaganda. Any strategy that brings international attention to what is occurring there is a good one. Arafat should be applauded.
‚ÄúAs long as it is brown people suffering, it isn‚Äôt my concern.‚Äù
You can tell from my replies that I am a little person?  Do you have access to my personal information?

The US citizen mass surveillance system strikes again!
I‚Äôm not interested in neoliberal propaganda.
You refer to the Israeli Colonial project as if was a government representing the people in that area.
Most Jews are against genocide. But Islamophobia is always in fashion in America.
The newspaper name is literally""The Jewish News"". Wtf are you talking about?
Supporting israel's right to exist isn't supporting genocide and thats all zionism means. So if people believe otherwise they are either anti semitic or a self hating jew. They can call out netanyahu all they want. That doesn't make them anti zionist.

And I‚Äôve been in a classroom with both groups. A couple antizionists (taking a Jewish Studies course, btw) were of the opinion that the creation of Israel was flawed, but there‚Äôs no going back to 1948 and we must find a decent solution for peace that works with the reality today.
Most Gazans disagree with you. There are multiple polls and the conclusions are: most of them both support Hamas and the Oct 7 atrocities specifically, when asked. 

The amount of people cheering to the paraded naked women and celebrations on the streets on that day and the following day paints a damning picture. 


Children are obviously innocents and in general, I'd like Israel to chill tf down with their callousness - but this does not absolve the Palestinians as a collective from supporting this. 

They are not detached from the violence they support. The Israelis are also not detached from their reaction.

I don‚Äôt have issues that I want to make a significant difference for. Lmfao. Nor am I outraged. I‚Äôm living that simple life.
Free speech is not protected on private property. Free speech is sometimes protected on public property. Forum analysis only applies to public property because private property is private. 

I‚Äôve seen a few people argue that since their house is provided by the school it‚Äôs public property, therefore it‚Äôs a 1a violation. That is flatly wrong. Their house would qualify as a nonpublic forum. It is, at a minimum, ‚Äúa special enclave, subject to greater restriction.‚Äù Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky. That applies even to areas that are clearly and openly controlled by the government, like airports. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee. 

There is no serious 1a scholar who would claim that a private residence occupied by a private individual is a public forum. That interpretation would mean that any public housing is essentially a public forum, so if you qualify for low-income housing, and you have someone over for dinner who starts saying offensive shit, you would be SOL because your residence is technically public property. 

For your next comment, please read up on forum analysis and provide a citation for the idea that a private residence can be a public forum, or just admit that you‚Äôre wrong.
Lmfao I hope someone starts a protest in your living room
[https://youtu.be/sQwA4oO4Qdk?si=NTV2qgWJbPx7knyA](https://youtu.be/sQwA4oO4Qdk?si=NTV2qgWJbPx7knyA) outrageous stuff rlly, knowing some of the people on campus support this and refuse to see how their side has wrongdoing too.
I hope they invest more honestly
Yeah but I‚Äôm not crying about an issue online. I live my own life. I genuinely don‚Äôt care what transphobic, racist, sexist, homophobic governments do. Genocide each other for all I care. I‚Äôm happy for them that they‚Äôre getting what they want.
Heh why you mad ‚ò∫Ô∏è
This guy clearly cares more about his own feelings than the literal systematic murder of innocent people, his statement about the poster ""I never thought I would see such blatant antisemitism, with an image that invokes the horrible antisemitic trope of blood libel and that attacks me for no apparent reason other than I am Jewish"" is wild. 

He clearly was targeted by the poster for his abetment of zionism, not because he is jewish. The poster is clearly anti-zionist. zionism and being jewish are not one and the same. You can be jewish and still care about the lives of palestinians. Weaponizing your identity as a jew to avoid hard conversations about how netanyahu is a genocidal maniac enacting mass murder as we speak is gross as fuck and way more offensive than the poster.
Hence why I asked for more information...I agree with the sentiment of the poster as a jewish person myself and I don't think that these peoples' dinner is more sacred than the lives of innocent people in gaza. It is true that innocent gazans are being systematically bombed and starved and it is true that netanyahu is a zionist and anyone being an apologist for that vile, human-life-disregarding shit should be disrupted. I agree that it is bad to normalize the murder of civilians. I don't care if these posters fucked up the vibe of these extremely privileged, physically safe peoples' dinner...because innocent people are being killed. Am I losing my mind? Does the average person actually think that it's a heinous act to disrupt a dinner to call attention to a mass murder? If I am in the minority on this, then so be it but holy shit I thought people cared about human life more than this.   


Here is the poster I found: [https://reason.com/volokh/2024/04/10/berkeley-students-post-anti-semitic-cartoons-disrupt-dinner-at-dean-chemerinskys-home/](https://reason.com/volokh/2024/04/10/berkeley-students-post-anti-semitic-cartoons-disrupt-dinner-at-dean-chemerinskys-home/)
Well, you sure showed me! ¬†LOL

How many generations of ‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù beggars should the world support? ¬†How long are we going to let these losers cause absolute chaos because they cannot get a fucking clue that it‚Äôs time to drop the loser ideology and move the fuck on?

There‚Äôs not a single piece of land anywhere in the world that had not been bought, conquered, stolen, you name it‚Äîand only the ‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù losers can‚Äôt get on with living.¬†

Magical thinking that land you lost through various means, mostly because your people started stupid wars that they then LOST, is somehow going to be returned to you, is the thinking of backward LOSERS and FOOLS.¬†

Time to move into the 21st century and stop being the biggest beggars in the world stage. You have worn out your fucking welcome.¬†
Advocating for a persons right to be free from harassment on their own private property is not colonialism. Actually the right to poltical and economic sovereignty are key aspect to devolonization.
You can hear in real-time as they‚Äôre told by the Jewish Dean they decided to harass that he has no control over the investment issue they‚Äôre allegedly protesting by harassing him.
I believe that‚Äôs still summary execution by mob in Berkeley.
Being a mouthbreathing idiot isn't a crime last I checked
I've done that without the MAGA hat, and I was fine. With the hat on, I'd probably still be fine.
Which is the largest Palestinian student group at Cal that's politically involved? I'm out of the loop on these, it's been a while since I was in undergrad. I will seriously call them.

You're right about CAIR, but they aren't a student group: [https://ca.cair.com/sfba/news/cair-sfba-condemns-uc-berkeley-professor-alleged-assault-on-palestinian-muslim-law-student/](https://ca.cair.com/sfba/news/cair-sfba-condemns-uc-berkeley-professor-alleged-assault-on-palestinian-muslim-law-student/)
As I said elsewhere, above poster paraphrased. And the law school doesn‚Äôt have any say in UC investments, as well as the Dean personally. The main takeaway is that the protesters didn‚Äôt know a damn thing about what they were talking about‚Äîthey showed up at a Jewish prof and Dean‚Äôs home to be racist toward them based on unfounded assumptions rooted in their Jewishness. Following a bigoted, blood libel campaign.
'We agree with you about what's going on in Palestine,' she is heard telling the crowd toward the end of the blowuyp.

'Then what have you done about divestment? Nothing. Nothing,' a different student says, wailing.

'We don't control the investment,' Fisk insists, before the three-minute video eventually concludes.

I mean if you are going to ignore the ""genocides"" funded by Iran and previous ones you may want to put it in perspective.  That said, this event was not related to Israel's war against Hamas.  This group of students is just interested in creating havoc at private (and likely) public events.  So protest all you want but protest something that at least has something to do with what you are protesting.  This is like if the Armenian protests outside the Turkish Embassy just one day moved down the street to the Korean one.
I really don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs an ethnic cleansing, at least an intentional one. There simply is not evidence to support that conclusion to my mind.
>t Israel is wiping a population from existence simply because they think the land is the right of Israel.

1. Not even close.
2. This is basically holocaust denial
Calling people out for antisemitism is a thing. You just used the word Zionist when you meant Jews.
But she is an almost perfect representative of her cause.
Are you referring to the purpose of the UN where it mentions, among other things, respect for principle of the self-determination of peoples? That is not, by itself, the ""basis of the UN charter"" nor does it mean one gets an ethnostate.

Much of the purging of Jews, Christians, Yazidis, and other minority religions in Iraq happened under a brutal dictatorship or under ISIS rule in northern Iraq, where many of the minority groups lived most recently.

I do live in America (and, I am not Indigenous), but that doesn't mean I have some inherent right to and I do not deny the physical and cultural genocide of Indigenous Peoples. Your suggestion that that is my homeland is absurd, it even contradicts your basic argument since America is not a single nation (the Indigenous Peoples alone prove that, but even beyond that we have never been one nation in the traditional sense of the word). And if you're going to use that as your moral model, I guess there's no reason for Israel to stop after a genocide in Gaza.
I guess we'll have to wait several months for the ICJ to decide whether it's good that tens of thousands of civilians and children have been killed
Antisemites share an axiom that prejudice or discrimination against Jews is an ethical act. To *hold such an ethical claim*, you must have some *code of ethics* that consists of at least this axiom. Antisemites do not share a universal code of ethics, however, or else they would share their stances more broadly. An anti-semite can be of any political or moral persuasion because of this, just for the same reason may a racist.
It‚Äôs not ok, but it‚Äôs not a gotcha that people use made in China products but speak out against China‚Äôs crimes. It attacks the person and doesn‚Äôt say anything about what they‚Äôre actually saying. If the person only bought made in USA products, it would not change how valid their argument is. 

Some things you cannot avoid, or make it extremely difficult to avoid. Those RnD offices may be important, but not as important as all their operations in the US, and it is a US company foremost.

I believe Berkeley law does have its own endowment that is managed by UC Investments but would be used for the law school. UC Investments manages the money, they don't ""spend"" it. I'm sorry I think I might have implied there's only one big fund: there are quite a few endowments and retirement funds and cash accounts, etc.

You can think of UC Investments like a bank and the different endowments, retirement funds as account holders. That money is theirs but they don't control the investment process like you put money into a savings account but you don't control who the bank might lend it to but it's still your money.
I broadly agree that you should protest individuals, but I‚Äôm highly skeptical of a movement that specifically chooses a Jewish dean to protest, and creates posters of that Jewish dean with utensils covered in blood.

I think you‚Äôre asking good questions. I would hope that the students (adults who have college degrees and will presumably be practicing law in the fall) would find the answers to those questions as part of choosing who they want to protest. There are other comments in this thread explaining how the UC system spends its money. 

Imo, the fact that these students have not provided any evidence indicating that Chemerinsky has control over the problematic funds indicates that they either didn‚Äôt do their research, or did, and just wanted to protest at a Jewish man‚Äôs house. Either way, it‚Äôs not a good looks for a movement that I agree with.
Why would this guy have control over how Berkeley handles its investments? That is not the role of the dean. And no, they don't invest in Israel, I don't even know what that would mean. This is about Berkeley's investment in some corporations.
Israel has admitted that they want to wipe Gaza off the face of the Earth, they are calling for towns to be reduced to ""soccer fields""
No you're just all mentally twisted up with double thing, I will not be convinced by your mad rambling, cease fire, killing children is wrong
>remove someone from a restaurant for making a scene

You literally can't though? You can call the cops. Can only use force if they're being threatening. There is actually a whole sub genre of people who go to stores and make asses of themselves trying to illicit a response from business owners and then suing them lol

And private residence has the same rules, only the cops can force a non threatening person to comply.
You don't. If they aren't threatening you then you have to wait for the cops because without a threat there is no reasonable force.

>Arrest you for shoving someone out your door

You mean assaulting someone? Sure, that's their job.
Again, only if they pose a threat. Which this girl demonstrably doesn't, seeing as the ole lady seemed emboldened to try to snatch her phone lol

Read the first paragraph.
You can try and take the mic. These are all adults and graduate students. They aren‚Äôt children. The private nature of the event precludes the 1A being applicable. If it wasn‚Äôt the case then any private event on private land is open for trespass. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. There is no right to be loud when you want. Try it and it is likely someone will toss you from a private event. Try it where there are security or bouncers present and you will get handled.
Homeowners may use reasonable force to remove trespassers from real property. Fisk's actions followed her husband's request for the student to stop and leave, which the student subsequently ignored. You might have an argument if Fisk had hit her with a bottle or something, but that's not the case here. Fisk's actions were both reasonable and warranted by the student's behavior.

You realize you‚Äôre saying almost every prominent humanitarian organization as well as the UN Special Rapporteur, Human Rights Council, and so many Jewish politicians, historians, and lawyers are all antisemitic
Because what you‚Äôre saying is insanely stupid
I really thought the reference to four times was more than obvious, but one sides defensive war was another sides genocidal atrocity, four times...so yea...insanity wins.
Stop pretending like you give a shit about either lol
sick burn man, you rlly got me. Have a nice weekend.
Where are you getting these numbers? The open source estimates I see are an IDF claim of 8k hamas militants killed, a human rights watch group saying about 2400 hamas militants killed and Hamas itself claiming 10k hamas militants killed. The only somewhat trustworthy source here imo would be the human rights watch group, but let's pretend all of them might be correct: 

The human rights watch estimate means a 92% civ death rate  
The idf estimate means a 75% civilian death rate  
The hamas estimate means a \~70% civ death rate 

Are \*ANY\* of these civilian death rates ok with you? Are any of these civ death rate estimates indicative of a successful anti-terorrism operation?
What isn‚Äôt a blood libel to someone like you lmao
Let‚Äôs not nitpick over civilian to combatant ratios, they mean less than you think. 
Hamas‚Äôs civilian to combatant death ratio (those killed in Israel October 7th plus IDF and Israeli civilians since then) is better than Israel‚Äôs civilian to combatant ratio. (Fewer civilians per combatant). 
Does that mean you think Hamas is very humanitarian and they are doing a great job of avoiding civilian casualties?  Or is it possible that the attack on October 7th was bad, and Israel killing well over 20,000 civilians is bad no matter how many combatants have been killed?
‚ÄúIn all likelihood‚Äù. Not at all. You get your ideas from what you want to believe, not what‚Äôs real. 

I personally know people who were there lol. They‚Äôre also very much against Saudi Arabia. Again, if you knew anything about the topics you comment about, you would know Palestinians hate Saudi Arabia as well. And love Yemen.

Saudi, Israel, and the US work together. Of course Palestinians and Yemenis know and are on the same side. 

Stop being a hater and just learn
What Hamas was elected to do was build a state.  The second they were elected, after more than a hundred thousand Israelis were ripped out of the only homes they knew, leaving behind the beautiful greenhouses that made the desert bloom with food - Hamas destroyed them all.  Then they proceeded to take $4B in aid and build the terror tunnels under the civilians. They were supposed to be building their own infrastructure!  Gazans STILL depend on Israel for water and electricity even tho they could have continued their own building of solar energy and desalination of water.  They chose to destroy and fight.  You cannot blame Israel.  Go back and read about 2005, and how on the DAY AFTER elections - rockets started being launched into Israel.   Truly - do some reading and stop parroting this propaganda.
Hamas can do more 10/7's, which I suspect is ok with you.
Ok bye, you‚Äôre not a serious person
Especially when you are busy spreading your own.
Well, you wrote ""it's a Jew's newspaper"" -- I see you corrected your comment. But yeah, that's what I was talking about about, cuz that's what you wrote. The name of it is actually The Jewish Weekly, btw, and I don't think their report is ""biased."" The students were totally out of line.
And I‚Äôm wondering what alternate term you can propose here. Even if you were originally invited into a space, the second you are asked to leave and do not comply you are ‚Äútrespassing.‚Äù
Well then those kids were Zionists. That‚Äôs what that means. If you believe Israel has a right to exist and defend its existence, you support Zionism. And it‚Äôs ok! That‚Äôs a good thing!
I'm not sure what to say other than that these people are kinda silly. Countries can't be invalidated due to the circumstances of their founding, virtually every country was forged by war. Are these people just anti-national in general? If so, I would expect them to extend that viewpoint equally to all nations and not just Israel. My understanding is that those people think ""Israel exists unfortunately, but we can't do anything about it"". Do they feel the same way about Greece, Japan, Poland, Armenia, and the Arab states? It's not like those were founded cleanly.
I think that living under terrorists probably skews the polls a bit. Kind of like the support for Putin in Russias elections.
I don‚Äôt think any group of 2 million people anywhere is that monolithic, unless of course you don‚Äôt actually consider them people and more equivalent to herd of cattle or something. 

In either case, your description doesn‚Äôt seem to leave much choice beyond culling the entire population within Gaza, is that what you would support or do you think there‚Äôs a more humane alternative despite your bleak view of the population? 

Also, the population there skews young, I think 30 percent or something are children. Are children born there inherently evil or do you think they could be redeemed somehow?
Now replace ""Gazans"" with ""Jews"", and you've got retro Nazi propaganda! ""Never again?"", more like "" our turn now!""
So live the simple life and don‚Äôt yuck our yum.
Damnnnnn
>1a and private property

The private property isn't the issue here though?

They were public employees who, in capacity of their job, invited students of their public university over for a function. 1A gets complicated with this real fast lol but yeah they're subject to it. 

The issue is not them using their property, it's that they're public employees working in capacity of their job. Which puts them under 1a. I hesitate to link [this explanation](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/private-property-expression-on/) because it's more than a few sentences so I feel like a commenter will misinterpret but basically public entities still have to respect 1a on private property.

The case you linked is regarding polling places lol which yeah are generally ""special forums"" lol
Right? Id have to call the cops to get them removed, so annoying. But I prolly wouldn't assault them on video lol that's a great way to make it go viral
Kk!
This is probably because it doesn't directly impact you. It's very easy to say callous things when you don't see it as your problem
Not mad. Disappointed
*applauds in blood libel* to be fair, it‚Äôs Chem‚Äôs fault for thinking he‚Äôd be spared at Berkeley just because he‚Äôs spent his entire life defending the right of protestors like these and because he‚Äôs stood up for pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

This Berkeley student comes as a Berkeley student.  Cardozo and Brandeis about to be the hardest schools in the country to get into.

ETA: Netanyahu is a self-serving racist fuckhead who can eat a  bag of cat shit. You are a Jew hater who can eat a bag of cat shit.
With all due respect that is not a reasonable expectation. People still have lives and moments of achievement to celebrate, life goes on despite tragedy happening elsewhere in the world. It does not mean they condone or support it.
Thanks for sharing that link, even though the article is very biased. It even accuses the student of physically endangering Professor Fisk, when the video clearly shows that onlookers has to approach out of fear that the student would fall down the stairs when Fisk was grabbing at the microphone.
??? Many people have not ‚Äúgot on with living‚Äù? There are many movements for indigenous rights here in the US - fighting encroachment upon reservations, combatting food deserts that unjustly impact indigenous populations, investigating and getting justice for forced sterilization in the 70s, working to preserve native traditions, culture, and language. And many people support those movements because they‚Äôre good and kind and know that the decimation of indigenous populations was horrific and has negative implications for indigenous people of the Americas today. (You are apparently not one of those people?)

It is honestly so interesting that your argument is not that Palestine was not stolen but rather that they should just get over it (and you say it very angrily) like I feel like I can‚Äôt even argue because it‚Äôs such a bizarre position to take.
Did you even read my reply lmao
The dean is a Zionist that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre mad. They‚Äôre not mad because he‚Äôs Jewish. They‚Äôre mad because he wants genocide to continue.

>this event was not related to Israel's war against Hamas.

Yeah that definitely is the biggest critique of an activist. It's like those climate activists destroying paintings... like yes climate change is a problem but did you really have to go destroy priceless art? 

>I mean if you are going to ignore the ""genocides"" funded by Iran and previous ones you may want to put it in perspective.

I dont see why people have to make a list of every genocide in history just because they have critiqies of israel. Sounds like whataboutism to me
His comment did not say that the holocaust did not happen, it's saying that they're are striking paralells between the intentions of Israel and Nazi germany
if you can't separate being jewish from being zionist (i.e., a genocidal colonial occupation), then that's on you and no one else.
Point 1: I am referring to the reason why the UN was created in the first place and why countries were enticed to join. From the [UN website](https://www.un.org/en/model-united-nations/history-united-nations#:~:text=THE%20HISTORY%20OF%20THE%20UN,League%20of%20Nations%20was%20adopted) (emphasis mine):

>[Atlantic Charter](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/atlantic-charter)¬†(August 1941)

>In August 1941, the Axis powers seemed to have the upper hand. Although the United States was giving moral and material support to the Allies, it had not yet entered the war. One afternoon, two months after the Declaration of St. James Palace, news came that President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in conference ‚Äúsomewhere at sea.‚Äù On 14 August, the two leaders issued a joint declaration known as the Atlantic Charter.

>This document was not a treaty between the two powers. Instead, it declared ‚Äúcertain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they based their hopes for a better future for the world.‚Äù

>The Atlantic Charter also affirmed the basic principles of universal human rights:  
**No territorial changes without the freely-expressed wishes of the peoples concerned**  
**The right of every people to choose their own form of government**  
**Equal access to raw materials for all nations**

>The Atlantic Charter created a profound impression on the embattled Allies. It came as a message of hope to the occupied countries and held out the promise of a world organization based on universal moral principles.

>¬†

>[Declaration by United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/history-of-the-un/preparatory-years)¬†(1 January 1942)

>On 1 January 1942, Churchill, Roosevelt, Maxim Litvinov of the USSR, and T. V. Soong of China signed a short document. This document later became known as the Declaration by United Nations. The next day, representatives of 22 other nations added their signatures. **The governments that signed this declaration pledged to accept the Atlantic Charter.**

This was the first ever time in history when the right to self-determination was recognized as the foundation of diplomatic relations between countries. Which was obviously extremely attractive to smaller, vulnerable countries caught up in various alliances in WWII. Without this guarantee of self-government, the Declaration by United Nations would have never been universally adopted.  I agree it does not mean one gets an ethnostate, but it does mean they get **a** state.

Point 2: The purging of Jews was complete decades before ISIS existed in Iraq. It was done by the Hashemite kingdom who were indeed brutal dictators. But I don't see what this has to do with whether Iraq is an ethnostate or not - especially because all the laws that were passed at the time (ex. Jews not allowed to be citizens) are actually still on the books there, surviving the transition to a republic government. They are by every definition, both demographically and legally, far more discriminatory to Jews than Israel is to Muslims.

Point 3: Yes, you do have a right to live in America, based solely on your ancestry. Almost every country in the world has similar citizenship rules. In fact, not only do you have the right to live in America, assuming you don't have dual citizenship, you ONLY  have the right to live in America and not anywhere else!! I don't know what else to call that but your home.

I'm also not sure how many nations you think live in America, but to the extent of your right to live there and participate in self-government as defined by the Atlantic Charter, that extends to everywhere in America outside of Native American reservations, regardless of which nation inhabits which part of the country.

So in summary, you don't get an ethnostate, but as an American you do get a state, just like every other person you do have the right to a state. It just so happens that your American state has many characteristics of an ethnostate, perhaps even more than Israel or Iraq.
no, we don't have to wait for them to decide its bad. but we do have to wait for them to decide if it's genocide. not a hard distinction to make
So what ethics are you talking about?
I'd argue differently. At least in UCSD they want to divest in subway for: being owned by a ROARK which invests in Isreal. 

Starbucks: which has repeatedly denied their support of Isreal.

Burger King: gave free food once to isreli military after Oct 7 attacks.

I find it incredibly hypocritical to want to divest in this while there's been 0 protest or mention of china actively profiting of a genocide. 

I'd argue apple having offices in Isreal is more of a tie than any of these.
does the law school invest in Israeli corporations? in the video, the protesters say this is about the *law school*'s divestment, not the university writ large. if yes, then who should these students protest, if not the dean? (whether this particular event was an appropriate venue for protest, thats a different issue, but I am seeking clarity on the merits of the protest right now, unsuccessfully)
The literal charter for Hamas denied Israel's right to exist and called for their total destruction.
who is ""Israel""? the current leaders of the war in Israel (as despicable as they are) are not in favor of doing so. although I did hear some mayors saying they want to ""turn Gaza into Auschwitz"" but that's like saying ""America has admitted they believe in jewish space lasers"" because marjorie taylor greene said so
You are incorrect on this. Bouncers throw people out of bars, clubs and restaurants all the time. You don‚Äôt need to call the police to trespass someone.
You literally can. How are you not understanding this?
You don‚Äôt think a mob is threatening? These folks lucky they weren‚Äôt protesting in Texas.
That literally is just not true. Shoving or pushing someone off your property is absolutely considered ‚Äúreasonable force‚Äù for trespassing. That is not assault. Where are you getting this information from exactly?
>can try and take the mic

I mean sure, but you might get charged with assault (seems to be the case here)

>Adults not kids

Not really material

>Private nature

Government employee, in capacity of their job, students of the public school... 1A gets complicated but I'm pretty sure they're covered. Public schools have a lot of restraints on this stuff.

>Toss you

Cops can toss you. (If you aren't a threat ie self defence territory) Anyone else has to call the cops, including private security with very few exceptions. That's kinda why places pay off duty cops so much for security actually... That's why cops do evictions and why places like Walmart don't chase down shop lifters (outside of super specially trained LPs who still can't really manhandle you).
LoL dude yes I'm familiar I've linked this exact statute above but so many people can't actually read lol

To use reasonable force they must first be a reasonable threat. Nobody is a threat here, as evidenced by the old woman emboldened to try to snatch the phone. 

Thus no, they can't use force, they must wait for the cops to come arrest them.

Some places will let you do a citizens arrest but you still can't use force to restrain someone who is not a threat to you.

People think they can use force in so many more circumstances than you actually can lol
Its that i care about humanity as a whole i don't choose sides. I'm on the side of compassion for civilians. This mindset is usually what leads to actual peace. The other leadsto war.  Descalation and not taking sides unless they rxcplicutky oppose descalation should be the main foreign policy of the usa. An either or mindset is what will lead to world War 3.
Blame Hamas and demand to have US Army remove Hamas. They started it and they keep civilians in the harm‚Äôs way.
Someone like me? Care to elaborate?
Radically different scenario. What happened on October 7th was a planned, premeditated massacre intended to brutalize civilians and take hostages. It was an act of pure aggression and evil.

Israel's response has been a military campaign to remove the terrorist organization responsible from power so that the region can have long-term peace. It's like saying a serial killer who killed 10 people is the same as a US army veteran who bombed 10 Germans in WW2. Israel's response is a legitimate military campaign, Hamas's massacre was terrorism. Creating moral equivalence between those two is wrong.
You personally know people who were there? Good for you.  How does that explain the deafening silence from Bay Area performance artists when Saudi Arabia was bombing Yemen?
Ok. You say they started fighting the day after elections as if it is a bad thing. It sounds like fighting was the will of their people, and that their government is far more quick to follow through with their promise. Why do you think governments must be slow and cumbersome in order to be legit?
*looks at the US‚Äô and Israel‚Äôs long list of terrorist acts*

Yup, I‚Äôm A-OK with that.
You don't assault students for speaking. We live in a civilized society. If she was any other group the professors would have been fired by now. But America has always been okay with assaulting Muslims.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs not a binary.
I mean yeah they typically did. They were more lefty folks who believed that the horrific foundlings of countries need to be reckoned with, and since Palestinians are around and still have their own country (for now) they need to be considered and their sovereignty needs to be preserved
That‚Äôs infantilizing these fully formed people. Just because they‚Äôre not American doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt think for themselves.
71% of Gazans STILL support the Oct. 7th massacres which started this war, 6% undecided.

It‚Äôs true that as public employees they have some 1a obligations, but the link you sent does not apply to this situation. That article just talks about how private entities don‚Äôt have 1a obligations, it doesn‚Äôt delineate the times when state employees do and don‚Äôt have 1a obligations. 

For example, that article mentions that store owners are allowed to restrict picketers from entering their stores. Even though the 1a applies to government action, the store owner would be able to call the police (members of the government) to kick out the picketers (state action) because the store is not an appropriate forum for their 1a rights. The same is true here. The fact that the students were in a nonpublic forum means that they were not protected by the 1a, so action by governmental entities is permitted to expel them.
If you really want to make a difference, go work a job, use that money to donate to your pro-Palestine organization. Your Reddit comments and social media comments to polarizing sides of the argument literally do nothing
Yeah that‚Äôs how issues work bro. You think I‚Äôm gonna sit and be sad for 30 minutes worrying about someone else‚Äôs life or how someone else‚Äôs mom can‚Äôt pay rent or if I can‚Äôt even get my own shit together? Nah. Go be perfect then come back and lead by example.
Yea being in a position of leadership and public service usually means that you are (and should be) subject to criticism by people calling on you to do the right thing and support good causes.
I hear you but clearly for \*a lot\* of people the mass killing in gaza is not just some abstract, far away thing that they have the privilege to just stop thinking about because that's easier to do.
I'm sure your didn't read mine.  I'm not talking about the validity of zionism. I'm talking about an Americans legal civil rights.
Being a Zionist means believing Israel has a right to exist, and Jews have a right to live in our homeland after centuries of persecution in the diaspora.

I‚Äôm not sure how you get from that the idea that he ‚Äúwants genocide to continue,‚Äù other than racist blood libel conspiracy theory, due to his ethnicity. Has this Dean said things in favor of genocide of Palestinians? Furthermore, even the ICJ doesn‚Äôt think Israel is committing a genocide. So it would have to be genocidal rhetoric directly from the Dean himself that would justify this.
First - this is a war, started by Hamas, and Israel retaliated the way they always do - disproportionally.  I think that was the goal of Hamas all along but they did have a plan to take over the security services facility if they made it that far.  It isn't fair to Gazans that Hamas went (literally) underground and left their citizenry above to take the brunt of the response.  Hamas is the government of Gaza - they had to expect retaliation.  

I guess a proportional response would be for Israel to go into gaza kidnap a bunch of people, rape a bunch of others, and then retreat.  Not sure Gazans would want that either.
Congrats on the dumbest comment of the day
Eeeek. It‚Äôs odd how you Hamas supporters always try to twist these things. Palestine is the genocidal state that has actually committed genocide. Not the other way around babe.
[Ethics.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)
How is it hypocritical for more than one problem to be going on at once? You cannot protest against everything. While there is outcry against China, it is difficult to do much as much of our manufacturing is mainly outsourced to them, they account for 28% of the world‚Äôs manufacturing.
Anywhere else would be a better place to protest. Like on campus. They should be protesting the board that handles investments. The corporations I saw named were Boeing and Lockheed Martin, so no these aren't Israeli corporations.

They targeted this guy because he's a (((zionist))) aka doesn't want Israel eradicated.
Short answer is yes they do. Long answer is they invest in multiple companies that supply military equipment and electronics to Israel. This is a long known problem that has come up a few times in the past 20 years.
The people of a country should not be punished for the actions of their government, it's still wrong to kill civilians.
OK you got me there, I should've been more specific about the media sources and local politician hate speech towards Gaza.  But I still stand by my point that it is wrong to indiscriminately kill children and civilians, it's just wrong, I will not give up my humanity and be wrapped up in this double think
Bouncers can only throw out people threatening other people or property. It's in every training. You have to call the police if they aren't threatening, or else risk a lawsuit. This is also why people pay off duty cops for security, they can skip the extra stuff.

This is also why stores tell you not to physically confront shop lifters etc
You can't? Like that's assault? Obviously? Ask any bouncer they'll tell you. Actually don't, cuz bouncers catch charges on this stuff constantly lol

>If the trespasser does not leave within a reasonable time *and it would appear to a reasonable person that the trespasser poses a threat* to (the (home/property)/ [or] the (owner/ [or] occupants), the (owner/lawful occupant) may use reasonable force to make the trespasser leave.

Emphasis mine

You just aren't allowed to use force in very many situations outside of self defence. Which is a good thing.
In this case hands on would be battery and good luck there. 

Inviting adults to your private residence for a dinner is not official capacity unless the event is a university sanctioned event and I‚Äôm not sure this was. Faculty have done this at many institutions for years. The fact that he is the dean and these are student does add a wrinkle but I don‚Äôt think a person has a right to claim 1A at an event like this. 

If someone was making a scene at your house and you felt as if they were no longer welcome and possibly a threat (after the violence at the on campus speech) you could use force to remove them though it would open you to this type of allegation. 

This was just narcissistic disruption for the sake of and these student as graduate law 3rd years should know the difference. This reflects poorly on them and their decision making and will likely affect their reputations. 

The dean will be fine.
>I mean sure, but you might get charged with assault (seems to be the case here)

I will bet $100 to CAIR or any other legal non-profit you choose that either Afaneh will not bring a tort claim of assault against Fisk, and, if she does, Fisk will not be liable. 

Are you willing to bet $100 to the Jewish National Fund that Afaneh will bring a tort claim of assault against Fisk AND prevail?
Ultimately neither of our opinions will count for anything. I feel confident that any potential prosecutor is going to look at this and conclude that Fisk reacted reasonably to a trespasser at her and home and that any 'force' used was *de minimis*.
I agree, but a peaceful Israeli society is one that rests on stolen land. What do we do then?
Someone who thinks that saying there‚Äôs a 90% civilian death rate is ‚Äústraight up blood libel,‚Äù the one thing I know abt you lmao
>It sounds like fighting was the will of their people

I guess they got what they wanted, so they can't be *too* unhappy with the result.
They started building tunnels that have forced israelis to kill civilians as well as using civilian sources as their bases. That's considered a war crime by the UN.
Oh bullshit re ""America has always been OK etc."" Students were totally over the line with their behavior and it doesn't matter what their origins were. Behave like assholes, don't expect coddling. Reminder that UCB has failed repeatedly lately in cases where Jewish students were harassed and physically attacked on campus by the pro-Pal brigade. If anything they've been extra lenient with Muslim students and the anti-Israel pro-Hamas protesters.
problem is she engaged in the legal definition

'student was invited to a dinner and then tresspassed'

  
does that work well?
Let‚Äôs try to avoid terms like ‚Äúhijacked‚Äù when speaking about activism from Muslim students please.
It absolutely is.
Explain how someone can be both Zionist and Anti-Zionist.
They're living in an alternative world then, since the Palestinians have never had a country and have only recently formed as a national group. They have been offered sovereignty alongside Israel but have declined every offer.

They also ignore that Israel attempted to be founded entirely through legal means, and that it was the Arab side who decided to settle the matter violently.

At the end of the day though, those people just have an ideological perspective that the vast majority of the world disagrees with. They likely are somewhere along the anarchist camp. My personal opinion on anarchists is just that they are silly people who have little experience in the real world.
Define ""fully formed"" as most are under the age of 18
Not saying the information is necessarily wrong, but how was it possible to conduct a public opinion poll in Gaza rn?
It‚Äôs going to need a deradicalization through a coalition occupation of friendly arab states led by the US. Timescale prob on par with Japan and Germany.
The person you are replying to is a troll. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
You'd need a judge but almost certainly they have 1A protections to their speech vs the public employees but could still be trespassed (they'd need to call to cops to remove them if they don't go voluntarily though, as they aren't threatening).

But yeah glad to see you come around on this stuff. 1a gets to complicated so fast lol
What did I say that made you think I don't...? People can do multiple things at once lmao
‚ÄúSubject to criticism‚Äù = ‚Äúhave Jew hating posters made
Of you and people bust up your dinner to tell you you suck‚Äù. If that‚Äôs your position own it. Hiding the ball makes your argument that much more pathetic.

Once a Jew hater, always a Jew hater.
It‚Äôs a stretch to say that because a dean hosts recent grads to celebrate their accomplishments that none of those people have been thinking about Gaza. Students work hard for years to achieve their dream, one night of celebrating their success doesn‚Äôt mean that Gaza is being ignored.
Welcome to the world of the grey areas and civil disobedience
Supporting Israel rn and their assault on Gaza means you support slaughtering 30,000+ civilians and intentionally starving them. As well as stealing their land for 75 years and imposing harsh restrictions on them. As well as murdering Palestinians throughout the past 75 years.
Israel did not start killing palestinians after october 7th. They assault the gaza strip somewhere between every 5 to 10 years. What Hamas did was awful, and if I had it my way no one would be hurt on either side. But it's astounding that one of the most advanced militaries in the world didn't expect an attack after they've been slowly stealing land and killing and torturing innocent people for decades.
An actual fool.
That‚Äôs just a Wikipedia page
it isn't, and I absolutely agree with the protests.

However divestment? That's where it gets hypocritical. Sure if a company actively funds the isreali military then I understand. Pretty much all of them just have loose ties or offered support immediately after Oct 7 attacks. 

Oh this company offered support after Isreal was attacked, we should remove them from school. While you have companies directly benifiting from slave labor.
so you agree the only difference between people speaking out against China and speaking out against Israel is that it's easier to do so against Israel? I call that laziness
No, because he is a Jew.
yes I also found the poster a bit gross for reasons I can't fully articulate, but i think it's best to assume everyone here is in good faith until proven otherwise
Zionism is an ethnocentric and nationalistic belief that is largely to blame for this conflict.
The same goes for isrselis. Anti zionism is punishing their right to exist as a country which has nothing to do weigh sorry for genocide. Killing civilians is part of every war by that logic. If you think killing civilians in war is genocide then ask war is genocide. Why aren't you protesting every war of you truly believe this? Sudsn for example. I don't see this same sentiment fit the stretching sudanese people bring Steve by their own governmrnt. Guess their governmrnt isn't Western enough for you to care about them.
LMFAO. No.
Are you actually well-versed with American law? Or are you just talking out your ass? Would love to see the evidence to back up your claims
You literally can. I am a practicing attorney in CA. Where are you licensed to practice?
Yeah you‚Äôre literally proving my point lol. Funny how you skipped the next line: ‚ÄúReasonable force means the amount of force that a reasonable person in the same situation would believe is necessary to make the trespasser leave.‚Äù

If pushing them in your eyes is assault and not reasonable force, what do you think would be reasonable force? Flicking them in the chest? 

Someone refusing to leave your property absolutely can and almost always is viewed as a threat and pushing someone off your property is absolutely reasonable force in that situation. You would basically have to attack them with weapons or beat the living shit out of them and continued after they tried to leave for it to not be considered reasonable force. 

Do you have an example that shows otherwise or did you just make it up?
>adds a wrinkle

I mean, yeah, a pretty decisive wrinkle. This is clearly an event for student by faculty and admin...

>Threat because of other violence

That... That isn't how self defence works.

>narcissistic

Such an odd turn of phrase lol. They're doing what they think is right, using their rights and access to advance an ostensibly good cause, and they aren't far off base. I think most people would agree with the message, they didn't hurt anyone or block any ambulances or what have you. Seems solid as far as protests go.

>Dean will be fine

Yeah totes he handles it perfectly. If his wife had just chilled out wouldn't have been more than an article in the school paper.
Nah they'll prolly keep it in the school and settle
Is not stolen. In not debating this part. Both jews and palestinians have s long continous ancestry in the region and this thinking is actually racist by assuming all they are european. They just need to accept each others shared ancestry and get over it. If they would both rather like each other then so be it. We've done what we can and can only help the civilians. To an extent, we have a shared dark humanity, and we all have this propensity for and will we can do our attempt to transcend that.
Like this https://youtu.be/6nLnNP_bk6M?si=LueGd_55bcJmyUia?

For every fake actor with alligator tears, I can link you to an article where a Muslim was shot or killed for protesting (listed 3 articles below for reference)

Yet all you hear on the news and politicians is antisemitism is on the rise. Yet literally Muslim being murdered and no one even talking about it.

The link clearly shows their methodology.  It's all above board, from the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.

Here is their mission statement:

>PSR is an independent nonprofit institution and think tank of policy analysis and academic research. PSR was founded with the goal of advancing scholarship and knowledge on immediate issues of concern to Palestinians in three areas: domestic politics and government, strategic analysis and foreign policy, and public opinion polls and survey research.  PSR research units conduct and organize four types of activities: research and policy analysis, empirical surveys and public opinion polls, task forces and study groups, and meetings and conferences. The units focus on current public policy issues with a special reliance on empirical research as a tool to advance scholarship and understanding.

>PSR is dedicated to promoting objective and nonpartisan research and analysis and to encouraging a better understanding of Palestinian domestic and international environment in an atmosphere of free debate and exchange of ideas. PSR is registered as a nonprofit institution in the Palestinian Ministry of Justice.
You‚Äôre here ‚Ä¶ on Reddit. You need to work more. Pickup more shifts. Clearly it‚Äôs not enough cause you have the energy to come on here with sand in your vjj. Or you don‚Äôt care that much ig
Theres no gray area. One of my replies already discussed this.
>stealing their land

You need another history lesson my friend.  First Nomads, then Egyptians, and later the Israelites and Palestinians arrived.  Who stole who's land is an argument used by ""Select Historians"", such as Putin and Jinping, who like to live in history...but not just history, on this specific page and paragraph in history.  

By your standard, wasn't Gaza stolen from Egypt?  Mongolia controlled a large portion of China at one point, shall we go back to that page in history?  Spain conquered most of the known world, shall we redraw the borders to that page?
Supporting zionism has nothing to do with supporting genocide. It just means israel has a right to exist. The end. Nothing else. Protesting people for being zionist in this way is just anti semitic. If he supported netanyahu wiping or the palestinians then he would be supporting a genocide. Supporting a countries right to exist at no point ever had anything to do with Supporting genocide and the same would apply to Germany during the holocaust.
After the UN Created palestine and Israel the surrounding countries immediately attacked.  Israel won that and took land to increase their security.  Then in 1973 they were attacked again, won again, took more land to increase their security.  After that the settlement movement started and started taking land unprovoked.  That is a problem that people have been working to stop for decades.  Israel left Gaza in 2005.  

In June of 2006 after a soldier was kidnapped Israel responded with air raids and incursions.

In December of 2008 after a rocket barrage directed at Sderot Israel launched a 22 day long military offensive that ended in a cease fire.

That ceasfire ended in July of 2014 when Hamas kidnapped and killed three teenagers - That war lasted 7 weeks.

  
March 2018, May 2021, and August 2022 Israel launched airstrikes prompted by rocket fire and in the case of 2022 another barrage.

  
The March 2018 attack that targeted protestors at the Gaza fence was the only major event where Israel was not retaliating.
To the connotation of ethics that I am using, which you asked me to clarify.
Protests are sometimes misguided, and will not always be effective unfortunately. It is good to replace the chains with local stores in general, but it is quite a weak target for protests, which I agree.
Lol why do you think I did the parentheses?
The poster had Chem holding bloody utensils (I've seen other versions of the poster without blood) which suggests that he is personally responsible for the deaths of Gazans. Very bizarre. There's nothing remotely good faith about this from their side. Maybe they were accidentally antisemitic (the poster strongly resembled blood-libel cartoons, google it), even if it was an accident they should clarify and apologize.
The goal of Zionism isn't to create an ethnostate if that's what you meant by ethnocentric. Obviously it's ""nationalistic"" since it's about the creation of a nation lol. Today being a Zionist means you don't want Israel dismantled, a very sane and normal opinion.
I didn't say it was a genocide but it's definitely a war crime
LMAO. Yes.

Wow that's easy.
I mean here's the [law in question](https://lawofselfdefense.com/jury-instruction/ca-3475-right-to-eject-trespasser-from-real-property/#:~:text=If%20the%20trespasser%20does%20not,to%20make%20the%20trespasser%20leave.)

Emphasis mine
You literally can't though? You criminal?
So um yeah a threat is a requirement to get to that point. That's my point.

And yeah, pushing someone who isn't threatening you is pretty text book assault.

>Almost always viewed as a threat

... That just isn't how anything works dude. Like you need an actual threat lol. Now could you lie or whatever? Sure I guess lol. Harder to do with witnesses and video etc.

And no you really really can't just start pushing people just cuz they're trespassing. You call the cops, the cops handle it.
I still think this is a private event. As such if they intended to protest they could‚Äôve done so outside. Accepting an invite with the intention to disrupt is not in good faith. 

It is an event by a private individual at their home and just because he is administration and faculty doesn‚Äôt mean that every thing he does with students is a school event. 

Of course they did not end up causing any issue but you have no way of knowing once it starts. 

Why did they choose to actually disrupt the event by attending in bad faith.
Sure, in that case, we'll both pay nothing. So, do you accept? If not, you clearly are not confident that Fisk committed assault.
I certainly don't assume all or are European. It's just sad that a country established to help support Jewish people meant death and banishment for so many non Jewish people
True, but I‚Äôm going to be honest, she did illegally trespass, I don‚Äôt think she deserves sympathy for that
I pray this comment can be a mirror for you to reflect on your own opportunities for growth. Be well.
It is.  A person can personally want nothing to do with israel as a non zionist while letting others create a Jewish state and showing it to exist. That isn't the same as being anti zionist which doesn't allow such to exist. No integrative complexity is needed.
Some ideas just shouldn't be taken seriously in my opinion. I don't hate anarchists, I just don't perceive them as grounded in reality or as having any useful understanding of the world. I think everyone perceives certain ideas that way, after all people can't give weight to every single viewpoint they hear.
Are you not also here rn...? üò≠üò≠
‚ÄúSan in your vjj‚Äù tell me you‚Äôre an incel without telling me you‚Äôre an incel. Disgusting ass.
It's not as simple as Arab nations attacked Israel. Israel was established in a land that was previously inhabited by other people. I'd love if there was peace in the region, but it's not surprising that they attacked. The UN did not ""create"" Israel and Palestijne. The British initially established Israel in 1917 under the Balfour Declaration and the UN in 1948 with the Partition Plan. Both made a mistake in establishing Israel. The Ottoman Empire in control of the region was losing stabilization and came under British control when the Ottoman Empire began to fold.

I dont think the world would mind the Zionist Ideology so much if they they established a home in a place where there weren't already people living there and didn't need to kill people to enact it. Your answer mentioned the conflict in 1948 but conveniently left out Israeli militias killing palestinians and forcing them out of their homes in the 1948 Nakba. I wouldn't be surprised if this helped creat terrorist groups like Hamas. 

Recebtly, multiple Israeli officials have also stated that the palestinians are animals. That they are okay with killing and/or collectively punishing the 2.3 million people with no food, no water, electricity or shelter if it means finishing off Hamas. All the hospitals and schools and ~130,000 homes are completely destroyed, ~260,000 partially destroyed. I can understand if there are terrorist cells in a few schools and hospitals, but very unlikely that all of them are. I don't see any logical way that this can even be considered a ""war"". 

Hamas is by no means righteous in their actions, but Israel has commited 30+ Oct. 7ths, since Oct. 7th.
So you are just using ethics in general?  Is everyone supposed to abide by your decision?
the blood was edited in
Dude. Stfu and stop trolling. You are wrong.
So you‚Äôre proving yourself wrong? I‚Äôm confused.
Are you holding yourself out to be an attorney?
Yes, you can. This is just sad.
No it literally isn‚Äôt and trespassing absolutely is a threat. Like literally just read the link you just posted. If you are so sure of yourself answer the questions I have asked. What in your mind is considered ‚Äúreasonable force‚Äù as described in the quote I just wrote from the page you linked? 

How are you going to honestly say if someone walked into your house and refused to leave when you said get out you would not feel threatened lol.
>bad faith

Not a legal term but yeah I think they hoodwinked em here. Common protest tactic, think they pulled it off really well here, the best thing that can happen is the host over reacts and causes the whole thing to blow up.
I mean, if the null is nada I'm in lol

I look forward to the notification in a year or 2
That's been the case for jews for thousands of years.  Banishing then won't solve anything in achieving historic justice.
Smh really just denied that people can have varied opinions said ‚Äúno u‚Äù instead of having a discussion
I agree that you don‚Äôt have to give weight to every opinion, but you do have to give weight to the reason people hold the opinions they do. Otherwise, your understanding of their views will be flawed and you‚Äôll never be able to properly determine validity. As long as you do that you‚Äôre fine imo
Am I outraged about an issue I claim to care about? No. Use some critical thinking ffs üôÑüôÑ
The Jews that were there when Israel had also shared that land with Arab and Bedouin for the same historical time periods. They were the ‚Äúprevious‚Äù and current inhabitants. The difference is that post WWII Jews were forced out of Europe and many went to Israel (within those original boundaries). What you describe as a mistake is the only logical solution after two decades of sectarian violence.
I'm not even sure what you are asking me anymore. You asked me to clarify what I meant by 'ethics' when I said that people have moral axioms that inform their codes of ethics. I clarified my usage of definition, which is a fairly standard one.

No where did I posit what ethics one *ought to abide by* or suggest someone ought agree to mine in this exchange. If I did, please point to it.
How do you know?
It was edited out. Their initial post had it, then they altered it.
I'm not tho lol
Read the emphasized part. Need to be a threat for force to be allowed (ie self defence) which has been my contention from the start because I'm, like, familiar with how laws work lol
Who are you the internet police lol

I guess that means you ain't criminal, so prolly go check the statute again and get back to me lol
Was there an update on the case or just coming back to this 2 weeks later?
>trespassing is a threat

... It isn't though? Like please link where you heard this lol

You can force someone to leave. By calling the cops and getting them to remove the person. You cannot assault them to make them leave. And you don't wanna live in a world where that is true lol

Even castle doctrine only applies to threats... Which this lady isn't lol
I want a country, where Israel/Palestine are, where Jews and Arabs/Muslims can both live freely together, like before ‚ù§Ô∏è
You don't get to have an ""opinion"" on a well defined term. Zionism is a term coined by Jews and was consistently used by Jews for centuries now. You don't get to redefine what it means because you feel like it.
I used to somewhat align with this viewpoints when I was younger. That's probably part of why I'm so fed up with them.
You are hysterical üòÇüòÇ
Ok, so if people aren‚Äôt bound by whatever ethics you follow then why are they bound by the morals you follow?
[here](https://twitter.com/vote4tracyflick/status/1778541526693580856?s=19)
Yes. You are. Go to law school and STFU
No, there needs to be *reasonable fear* of a threat to person *or* property. You‚Äôre not even citing the case law right. It makes explicitly clear that the threat does not need to be real, only the belief in the threat.

Regardless, it is still criminal trespass to refuse to leave a person‚Äôs property after being asked.

As others have stated, the law is not always clear as written. You must cite case law in a Common Law system (like the US) in order to make your argument serious.
Are you holding yourself out as an attorney?
Sorry I don't spend every minute on Reddit but yes even national organizations have weighed in and said Cherminsky did nothing wrong.

Why can‚Äôt you answer the questions? Why would you be delusional enough to think you can just dodge questions repeatedly while repeating the same thing I have already said is wrong? What a threat is is literally described in the link you posted above which shows why you are wrong. If a person feels they are threatened by someone trespassing, that is a threat.
I would be open to a power sharing arrangement if some kind or a place with zones based off of ties to the land historically. They all have the same genetics so their all indigineous.i wouldn't call it one state but a regional governtment based on power sharing as the Levant is a region really. 

I do support a two state Stilton and would be fine with the un just giving palsstine official recognition. They need a third party mediator ngl. None of that is anti zionist and this not anti semitic either. I'm a left zionist btw.

There needs to be Bedouins and druze zones to

Anyone can live in a zone as long as they respecrhe ways and customs of the grip that zone is for with an interpretation of equal rights based on the philosophy of the ancestral group the zone is for. It would be like a consociation government with different flexible possibly overlapping to an extent zones based in inclusive sovereignty.
Good thing the opinion was about varied political stances and what that means in regard to whether one is a Zionist, not just the definition of the word
Nah but now that you mention it I‚Äôm gonna donate some money to Zionist groups or sumth anti-whatever you care about.
Once again, *I have never made such a moral claim* and if I have, *point to exactly where I said such*.

The only thing I claimed here is that, on the basis of purchasing phones, the two groups here seem to be biting the same moral bullet: purchasing a product from a group they propose to abstain purchasing products from. You haven't contested this in our exchange, you have only misdirected away from this. If you believe this is not the case, state so and give an argument.

I didn't even moralize the issue: I haven't qualified if this is a morally good or bad action to take. I haven't said if people ought to continue this behavior or not. I merely pointed out that it seems to apply to someone who also does not support slavery.
I'm no tho? Like for real real
You need case law when statutory doesn't cover an exact scenario.

This one... Is covered lol
Why don't you answer the question? You wouldn't be offering advice you aren't qualified to provide would you?

That would be unethical, which a *real* lawyer would never be.
What about fisk? And link?

And again are you criminal? Cuz I wouldn't want you to weigh in on something you aren't qualified for, especially with a license on the line lol

Edit: oh and also I'm glad this stayed in your mind so long, but you do use reddit quite a bit you have like 15 comments today lol maybe go, like, I dunno pretend to be reviewing documents or whatever junior associates do lol
>if a person feels

I mean, sure. But that's not how laws work. No reasonable person is threatened by this situation, which is the law. Thus no force is reasonable. See?

And no existing in a place is not a threat...
That's an interesting idea. Thanks for sharing.

What do you think about the ""right of return stuff""? Where many people were displaced when Israel was established. What zone would they go to?
Okay, have fun
You gonna get off your ass and pick up more shifts? Lmao
Yikes, NeverMind
Please provide case law saying that it isn‚Äôt reasonable to remove someone from private property after being asked to leave?
I am a licensed attorney. You are not. You have no clue how to interpret statutes. Courts interpret them. You appear to be holding yourself out as an attorney, which you are most certainly not.
Lmao sorry I'm not on reddit every waking moment. Rich coming from the kid with hundreds of comments this week.

How is this situation working out for you? I am literally a partner, good luck getting a job after OIC/EIW. Please, be exactly who you are on reddit when you are interviewing.
‚ÄúExisting in a place is not a threat‚Äù how can you actually be braindead enough to phrase it like this lol. If you honestly believe this why don‚Äôt you trespass all the time? Why not just walk into some rich guys house and start living there and then sue him if he touches you? 

Like go ahead and find some examples of someone being charged with assault for pushing someone trespassing and refusing to leave off their property if you are so confident.
From your link:

>If the defendant‚Äôs beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have actually existed.

Sure seems likes the law cares about feelings. Reasonable people can be threatened by large groups associated with racist beliefs disrupting their private party.

You have to affirmatively declare that it is unreasonable. That is a high standard, even if your other errors in law interpretation were to disappear.
You can only use force when threatened (ie self defence). Otherwise you need to wait for cops, monopoly on force etc.

[Here's the law (statutory, no need for case here cuz it's cut and dry)](https://lawofselfdefense.com/jury-instruction/ca-3475-right-to-eject-trespasser-from-real-property/#:~:text=If%20the%20trespasser%20does%20not,to%20make%20the%20trespasser%20leave.)

>If the trespasser does not leave within a reasonable time *and it would appear to a reasonable person that the trespasser poses a threat* to (the (home/property)/ [or] the (owner/ [or] occupants), the (owner/lawful occupant) may use reasonable force to make the trespasser leave.

Emphasis mine
Oh I know the law lol 

I'm sure you do a great job harassing interns and billing for document review you didn't actually do but you need to go ask a real criminal attorney and get back to me lol
I do trespass pretty frequently. I'll cut across a yard or grab my ball from another yard. Am I threatening when I do that?

No, trespassing doesn't automatically mean threatening.

And people get charged for fighting people on their own property literally all the time... 

[This is a recent story of people thinking trespassing works differently](https://www.foxnews.com/us/father-son-farmers-charged-killing-armed-trespasser), and the situation they had was wayyyy more threatening than this one lol
>affirmatively declare it's unreasonable

That's... That's not how laws work lol

This one is super easy actually: the old lady wasn't scared to try to snatch the phone, obviously not threatened lol
Please provide case law saying someone yelling in a loud speaker on your private property and refusing to leave your private property isn‚Äôt threatening? You aren‚Äôt a lawyer.
You are not a lawyer. You do realize falsely holding yourself out as an attorney is a felony in some jurisdictions right?
Did someone ask you to leave? Repeatedly? And you refused? Like how is it possible for someone at Berkeley to not understand how what you just said is different from the actual thing we are talking about. 

And the example you have when asking about pushing someone who is trespassing being reasonable force is someone literally shooting someone to death lol. Like holy shit does your brain have holes in it
It is? Reasonability is a defense against any battery claim the woman could make. There is a requirement to prove that Fisk‚Äôs fear was unreasonable, either beyond a reasonability doubt or to a preponderance of evidence, depending on the standard.

Also, no, a person acting to grab the phone does not prove she was not afraid. That‚Äôs a trivial failure.
The statute works here. They aren't threatening. They are trespassing. Call the cops and they'll come remove them and charge them for trespassing. Ez pz (just don't assault them lol)
Just an easy example lol.

And no, simply not leaving is not a threat lol

[Here's how I'm imagining your house parties go](https://youtu.be/GaazFYTrQ_A?si=TsFLZILaiQzH_kts) lol
No. It doesn‚Äôt. Please provide case law of your interpretation. A reasonable person could easily think that someone screaming on a loud speaker on private property and refusing to leave is threatening. You aren‚Äôt a lawyer.
>threatening young woman calmly talking with lots of people around, so threatening that an old lady feels confident enough to try to snatch her phone

LoL the ""they're coming straight for us"" theory of law gotta love it
You aren‚Äôt a lawyer.
YANAL sounds like a fun afternoon

Embarrassing for the whole Berkeley student community. There's a time and place for your protests and at the **dean's private home** when you were warned not to be disruptive and he's trying to build community is not it. Very unclear how these people except to be lawyers since they are so unserious and unprofessional with these performative stunts. Congratulations wasting 3 years of your life and 100K for law school I guess
Can someone tell me whether this student was invited and gave this speech, or wasn't invited and interrupted an event? Tweets about this are confusing me lol.
Honestly I am very pro Palestine but I think the reaction to this is ridiculous. And I have already seen so much misinformation about this incident. Not everywhere is the time or place for protest. And if you choose to protest at a private residence then you should deal with the consequences
Hopefully those students are kicked out
I hope those students get expelled. Is there an honor code at Cal?
Abhorrent behavior
these people are a literal hivemind, not a drop of critical thinking‚Ä¶ in all honesty this just makes their cause look bad and all those gate blocks are just starting to make me mad and irritated at them rather than raising awareness for their cause
Guys guys, the protestor wasn't just ""assaulted"", she was MOLESTED! /s

>""She kept on grabbing inappropriately at my breasts, and kept grabbing in my shirt area, trying to tug and pull,"" the woman recounted. Afaneh considers the action an assault and a violation of her First Amendment rights.

>""I was in pain, and I was scared, and I was terrified of what she was going to do to my body,"" she said.

Afaneh said she plans to take legal action against the school.

Yes, I'm sure a hetero white woman is just dying to feel up a girl in a hijab. Mhmm, makes total sense. What an absolute fucking joke. I just hope she never gets a Cal degree because all she'll do is sully it.

I'll never be 100% convinced that Saira Rao's account isn't secretly a parody. She might be the least self-aware person on Twitter -- which is saying a LOT.

Also, associating support for Israel with white supremacy is both disgusting and laughably ignorant. And accusing a Jew of being a white supremacist is doubly disgusting.
incredible lack of respect by the protests
Really, if this is not over the line behavior for prospective members of the bar, there is no line.  The law is all about consequences, to fail to apply consequences is to fail the entire concept of law itself.  Expel everyone that trespassed (I'm sure there is plenty of video).  Edit update: **CA PC 601**¬†aggravated trespassing is the act of making credible threats then entering victims home or workplace without permission and refusing to leave = a felony with serious prison time if convicted.
How do people think that posting up unwanted on private property is protected by the first amendment??
Look at my lawyer Dawg I'm going to prisonüòßüò¨üò´
1. I don‚Äôt know if the professor is racist, but no one has the right to disrupt a private party; 2. Further, after being asked to leave, and not leaving, is terrible conduct for a soon to be law school graduate.  What type of professional conduct is this?  3. I don‚Äôt agree with everything that has happened to the innocents in Gaza, but I also don‚Äôt agree with the kidnapping, rape and murder of Israeli innocents.  4. People, especially graduating law students, should know that not everyone wants to listen to political speeches, especially in someone‚Äôs private home during a celebration.  5. Bottom line, the law school should take action against these disrespectful and disruptive students, and the professors should file charges of trespassing on those students since those students were asked to leave
These people are disgusting ingrates, antisemites,  and an embarrassment to Berkeley. Chemerinsky is a class act and an unbelievably patient administrator.
The pro-Hamas crowd sure does love to make shit up.
Are we not all members of the Souse family?
Saira Rao makes her living by having ""Race2Dinner"" evenings, where she and her business partner will come to your house for dinner (which you provide) and proceed to harangue you for your racism.  All for a hefty fee, naturally.  I understand it's quite the rage among guilty upper middle-class white women.

She is clearly not a serious person and should be ignored.
This student is a muslim supremacist who planned ahead to act inappropriately at this party and use her 'religion' to sacrifice herself, she planned to offend her hosts, she clearly hates them and was trying to insult them.

She is abhorrent. She cannot separate her professional personal from the cult she is from.
They protested on the steps of her private residence and the lady essentially grabbed her phone and tried to physically disrupt the protester. The protesters tripped because the trespasser had a hijab on. God forbid you defend yourself against a hijabi üòÇ
Not sure why they think this will do anything to help their cause
Honestly I was done with this whole gaza/palestinain situation when you look a bit north and a literal democracy that wants to be aligned with the west is getting bombed and shelled every single day in Ukraine but the country that hates western ideology and wants us out of the region is the one that we should support lmao. You don't see ukrainian protestors pulling stunts like this garbage
Should have the book thrown at them for what is possible, at minimum tac on a hate crime charge to a trespassing charge if possible. Just saying random shiz now.
Castle law goes brrrrr
Terrorists gonna terrorize.
Twitter troll Saira Rao is upset because growing up in America. She was told that Indian people stink, their food stinks, etc. I think she should‚Äôve tried growing up as an Indian woman in Palestine or Saudi Arabia.
Since she identifies so strongly as an Indian, I expected to see something on any of her Twitter feeds about the recent assassination of Indian government employees in Kashmir. Or the vandalization of the Indian San Francisco consulate. Nope, not a peep. Maybe because the perpetrators in both cases are brown and not white? I guess liberal outrage can be racist, too.

Elsewhere, she says she‚Äôs all in for Bernie Sanders.
It‚Äôs so hypocritical that in secular liberal democracies, the loony left and the outraged Islamic activists march together. Nobody persecutes Muslims more than they do in communist countries, and good luck professing your socialist views in any of the Islamic theocracies.
What is 3Ls?
Watch the video, people. The student said, ""Peace and blessings upon you all. Tonight we are gathered here..."" at which point Chemerinsky said, ""Please leave."" He did not even listen to what she was about to say. Apparently this could only be due to his intolerance and bias against her clearly being Muslim. Ten seconds later, Fisk's arm was around the student's neck. The student was not doing anything threatening, and she was given only 10 seconds. This is unreasonable force and an unreasonable about of time to respond and leave. Shortly after she did agree to turn off the mic and leave, after assault and battery by Fisk.

If we can‚Äôt do this. Who will? Who will? No one is coming. No bright shiny father or mother figure to make it all better. This one is on us. Right now. Today. And we‚Äôd better figure it out well because this generation will be remembered for our decisions for our actions. 

How do you want to go down? Fighting for your way or fighting for a humane way?
Doxx each disruptive law student protester and circulate their identifying information to all major law firms, and all courts where the protesters might seek employment.
Well that's unfortunate for Professor Fisk. She should know better than that. 

Also very stupid for a 3L to believe they have a 1A right at someone's private residence. And it's clearly disingenuous to invoke The National Lawyers Guild to perpetuate your stupidity. 

She clearly did not take Professor Chemerinsky's con law class and should spend more time focusing on bar review than pointless protests to a captive audience who have no control over university investments.
Why are yall mad that a protest is disruptive all she did was do a lil speech she's better than me. yall really need to recognize that you're not as progressive as you think and you have little to no understanding of the function of protests
Being pro Palestine isn‚Äôt being antisemitic üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
UC Berkeley is an embarrassment
Chemerinsky and Fisk should be fired immediately
The Chemerinsky home is a private residence however it was being used for an event sanctioned by a public university, hosted by the Dean of a public university, for his public university students. You know, as in, publicly funded, as in... Congress shall make no law... A good argument for first amendment protection can clearly be made. And he knows that. Although the guy is insane or a liar. He states that Zionism = Judaism, and anti-Zionism = antisemitism.
Fire the dean and his wife!!
Telling a woman to stop talking about a current genocide is crazy. It‚Äôs a UC sponsored event, therefore UC policy applies even if it‚Äôs a private residence. The student has every right to engage in free speech at a university sponsored event.
Whatever the implications of the situation are, there was absolutely no need for Catherine Fisk to physically grab the woman and try to snatch her phone out of her hand. That is legally considered assault, whatever you all may think. It‚Äôs crazy that a law professor would put her hands on someone like that, whether or not it may have been justified. Any sort of forceful, unwanted touching is assault. And it‚Äôs especially disappointing to see a white woman doing it to a woman of color. If the roles were reversed and it had been a white woman speaking up, people would be handling this differently.
Everyone has a right to an undisturbed, private sphere, especially in their own home. A moral right, if not a legal one. Self-restraint is the only way that social cohesion can be maintained in the face of important obviously contentious issues. None of these people -- none of them, not the professor, nor his wife, nor their guests, nor the student, nor the protestors, nor anyone involved -- personally have anything to do with nor are in any way, shape, or form responsible, much less accoutable for the latest flare-up of the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East (the latest of many across the decades). Please, make an effort to look at things  from the proper perspective.

Disclaimer: I think Chemerinsky has been and continues to be a baleful influence on American law and jurisprudence in general, so there's no particular affinity for him or his legal and political views on my side.
As a democratic socialist, it's clear to me that your campus seems to be the worldwide (or at least U.S.) headquarters for Stalinist tankies and similar free-speech hating authoritarian excrement that discredits progressive movements when they have never been more needed. As far as a sane left-wing politics is concerned, virtually nothing good comes out of the Bay Area.
Is it really a private residence if it‚Äôs a house paid for by the university? Like the president‚Äôs house is for the sitting president but it‚Äôs not like an asset the belongs to them? My understanding is that the residence in question does not belong to Fisk/Chem

Catherine Fisk should have been arrested. Prof. Chemerinsky is a pro-genocide Zionist. 

UC Berkeley should be ashamed.
I mean, read this email from these delusional protestors claiming she was sexually assaulted

> , a Palestinian Muslim hijabi law student, who had stood to say a few words on the month of Ramadan, and uttered the Islamic salutation, ""Assalamulaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatu,"" translated to peace and blessings upon you in Arabic, was assaulted (tinyurl.com/FiskVideo) by Professor Fisk for exercising her First Amendment right. Fisk placed the student's head in a chokehold, and her hijab was tightened around her neck, impacting her ability to breathe. Professor Fisk simultaneously grabbed the student's phone and attempted to take it from her. When the student successfully held onto the phone, Professor Fisk struggled with the student and forcefully yanked her microphone away from her, dragging the student's body along with her. Continuously, Professor Fisk grabbed the clothes of the student and touched her breasts and chest section inappropriately, twisting her shirt and her outerwear.

These people are just... insane.
They understand. They're just lying. Screaming ""MUH FIRST AMENDMENT"" is a ploy to gain sympathy from fellow 85 IQs on TikTok. Not an actual attempt to convince a professor of civil rights law.
Or assault.
The first amendment was written by literal settler-colonists.
Exactly why they should not be able to be barred. Clearly they have learned nothing.
it was a social media stunt, the girl is a performer for her cult
Or not understanding castle doctrine
I mean it still does. You‚Äôre allowed to speak freely as much as you would be outside. You‚Äôre just not granted the right to stay there after the owner kicks you out for what you say. Video shows the claims of violence are way over blown but she was within her rights to stand up and start talking.
It‚Äôs a UC sponsored event, therefore UC policy applies even if it‚Äôs a private residence. The student has every right to engage in free speech at a university sponsored event.
UC Berkeley is a public university. These professors are public employees. They hosted a gathering for their UC Berkeley students at their residence. They invited the students who protested. 

The 1st amendment absolutely applies in this case.
So attacking the person is legal then?
There are legitimately people that believe she put her in a chokehold, i just cant seem to grasp how some of these people even got here

Yeah! Only protest when someone else decides the time is right! You need to respect peoples homes when they have paid to kill your family! Genocide can wait!
Wasn't she invited to the dinner being held for graduating law students? I've been to several similar functions and every time there has been someone who gets everyone's attention for a quick little talk about how far we've come and even takes some time to acknowledge any salient current events. We've never described it as disruptive before, not sure why we are this time.
I mean, you aren't allowed to lay hands on people though. This wasn't self defense. They needed to trespass her and call a cop.
[deleted]
So assault is okay?
All law students were invited, had to sign up, but were warned to not be disruptive.

From the [dean's statement](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/article/statement-from-dean-erwin-chemerinsky/):

>We were asked this year by the presidents of the third year class to have the graduating students over for dinner because they began in Fall 2021 when COVID prevented us from having dinners for them. We were delighted to oblige and designated three nights ‚Äì April 9, 10, 11 ‚Äì that graduating students could choose among. I never imagined that something that we do to help our community would become ugly and divisive.  
>  
>Last week, there was an awful poster, on social media and bulletin boards in the law school building, of a caricature of me holding a bloody knife and fork, with the words in large letters, ‚ÄúNo dinner with Zionist Chem while Gaza starves.‚Äù I never thought I would see such blatant antisemitism, with an image that invokes the horrible antisemitic trope of blood libel and that attacks me for no apparent reason other than I am Jewish. Although many complained to me about the posters and how it deeply offended them, I felt that though deeply offensive, they were speech protected by the First Amendment. But I was upset that those in our community had to see this disturbing, antisemitic poster around the law school.  
>  
>The students responsible for this had the leaders of our student government tell me that if we did not cancel the dinners, they would protest at them. I was sad to hear this, but made clear that we would not be intimidated and that the dinners would go forward for those who wanted to attend. I said that I assumed that any protest would not be disruptive.
Dean Chemerinsky has a tradition of having 1Ls over for dinner at the start of the semester. 3Ls couldn't make it in 2021 because of Covid so they were invited this week to have dinner before graduating. The student, and a few others, were all 3Ls that were invited and then subsequently interrupted the dinner.
Why does it matter if the student was invited or not? It was at a private residence
Chemerinsky was accused of things that might not even be true regarding his Israel stance.  He is being targeted because he is a Jew.  Pro-Palestinian people have been told this over and over again but their anti-Semitism is becoming an issue and it also hurts their cause.
same. I am pro-palestine and do believe in the distinction between Zionism and being Jewish but this is insanity. I'm actually an attorney and UC Berkeley alum and i'm so embarrassed right now...
What concerns me is before the protest even began they spread posters of  the Dean with a bloody fork and knife caricature that definitely looks problematic and disturbing to me.
I‚Äôm sorry was that student interrupting a genocide? For someone that is pro Palestine I went back into your comment history and it doesn‚Äôt seem to reflect it at all. This is the only comment I‚Äôve seen referencing it. Could be a fluke? 

Please. Would you have the same reaction to students protesting the holocaust?
Per the rule, disregard everything before the ""but.""
Chemerinsky is too nice. They absolutely deserve to be expelled. It turns out this student also put an anti-semitic poster up inside the Law school building - how is this being tolerated? 

Chemerinsky is a gem on our campus, but he is tolerating too much with this - remove the students immediately
NY Time‚Äôs (California Today) report on this incident this morning is very disappointing!
Another thing: ‚ÄúWe agree with you about what‚Äôs going on in Palestine,‚Äù Fisk says in a separate video as Afaneh and students leave.

‚ÄúThen what have you done about divestment? Nothing. Nothing,‚Äù a different student says as she walks away.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt control the investment,‚Äù Fisk replies.

These protesters are idiots.
Afaneh is going to be on the losing end of a defamation suit soon.
Honestly - colleges should just nip this shit right in the bud. Any form of protest that a student is involved with that breaks trespassing laws should lead to an automatic expulsion and blacklisting from all accredited universities. 

Peaceful protest and 1A is everyone's right, but NO ONE ever has any right to trespass and commit other crimes while protesting. Protesting \*NEVER\* entitles someone to immunity from criminal acts - and its about damn time that these idiotic students learned.
Yeah that's all lies. California has a strong anti-SLAPP statute. Hope she enjoys bankruptcy.
what has race got to do with it?
Is she really a white woman tho if these students have also been targeting them for being Jewish? If she were really considered white, they wouldn‚Äôt have turned this into a ‚Äúprotest‚Äù opportunity to begin with.
It's not an parody. She virulently hates Jewish people and thinks it is okay to target all of them.
Lots of these people have zero issues calling Jews Nazis for not wanting Israel to be destroyed.
""Jewish supremacy"" is literally a book written by Neo-Nazi, neo-confederate and KKK grandmaster David duke.... Who is by the way Dr. David duke now... As he got a degree from a Ukrainian diploma mill hate university with his thesis being ""Zionism as a form of Jewish supremacy"".... At the same time he was propagandizing in Russia about how the true issues of Russia are those ""Zionist oligarchs"" and he was also going to Iran's Holocaust denial festival, and lecturing around the Gulf about the evils of zionism and the Jews in places like Bahrain and Syria... 

Funny enough the first time I heard ""Zionist"" as a slur was neo-nazis... 

It's been interesting to watch terms that were once yelled by dudes with three teeth and swastika face tattoos while doing restoration of competency now become a concept I read on other professionals social media pages...

David duke Neo-Nazi influenced Russian propaganda is my only guess for that particular definition of zionism
Of course there are Jewish white nationalists, including Ben Shapiro and Laura Loomer.
Do you.. think making the choice to practice Judaism exempts you from being a racist? Like.. I‚Äôm curious why you think it‚Äôs disgusting to accuse a Jewish person of being a white supremacist. Can I convert to Judaism to also be immune to racial criticism? Bffr
That would require the campus and the ASUC to invest more in a united campus culture rather than frittering its money away on encouraging more and more smaller silos on campus.

Who brings their own microphone to completely disrupt an event like this.¬†

If I‚Äôd been the professor, after asking one time to get the fuck off my property, I‚Äôd kick her ass off the property.¬†
Exactly! Instead of supporting the only stable democratic country in the Middle East who actually did and does many things for this world while being constantly attacked by crazy jihadists people here want to support the jihadists. Truly amazing how far the brainwashing can go.
Ukraine is supported by the west, Palestine isn't
you stopped caring about innocent people getting killed because there's another war going on in Europe? tf is wrong with you??


Not to mention: the US *is* giving arms, intelligence, and massive support to Ukraine. A nation which *isn't* a democracy-- they literally just cancelled their elections ffs--, a nation that, despite having a war ongoing for 4x as long and facing full-scale invasion by one of the world's largest militaries, has suffered less than 1/3 of the civilian deaths.¬†


These aren't reasons to stop caring about Ukraine; they're reasons to realize that if you only care about one atrocity, one which is far less grievous and far more actively supported by your country, then you've got something much more wrong with you than any weirdo protestors. I don't support this protest either, but I'm not telling Palestinian children to get fucked because of some insane sense of deservedness.
What are you saying? that because she would recieve worse racism in another country she shouldn't complain about racism she recieves in America?
3rd year law students
I did watch the video.  I watched the extended one not the one on tick tock.  She then proceeds to discuss the situation in Gaza with the wife .

She didn‚Äôt get up just to give a welcome . She brought her own microphone.  She wasn‚Äôt scheduled to speak.  It was a preplanned stunt and if publicity is what she was going for - she succeeded.

No one will forget this. .
""Please leave"" means fucking LEAVE.
Why did it have to be because she was Muslim, and not because she was trying to grandstand during a private event?
I'm sure you'd be shocked to learn that the TikTok video being circulated was cut to remove all prior context, including the 20-30 times she was asked to leave before beginning to talk.
yikes.
In front of their homes is one thing; inside their homes is quite another.

I am not a lawyer, I cannot tell you the relationship between jury instructions and the actual law. (I'd hope they were close though)
What was the specific connection linking this particular even to Israel or Gaza?

If the protest is not being held at all UC events, including classrooms, then why this specific event?

Please answer and for the sake of the protest movement, do not say because Chemerinsky is Jewish.
What is the function of this protest? Did this little stunt free Palestine? Or did it just embarrass this future lawyer, make the movement look a little more anti-Semitic, and risk her whole career/education for... nothing?
Being antisemitic is not progressive.  People should support minorities like Jewish people if they are progressive
Sure, but targeting the Jewish dean over and over, making ""anti-Zionist"" posters about him specifically, then still showing up to this private home to disrupt events and ""protest"" his dinner when he asked you not to... is. 

Not to mention the LSJP group **celebrating Oct 7** and calling for ""glory to the martyrs"" before Israel even responded... It's looking bad for them.
correct. but many of the disruptors are.
But saying Jews are starving Gaza definitely is antisemitic
no it‚Äôs not. it‚Äôs historically an open forum of free speech and independent thinkers. sadly, that legacy has been misinterpreted by ill informed dilettantes that are trying to deflect and politicize their low self-esteem into misguided and misinformed theatrics.
so what would be the appropriate course of action?
 It‚Äôs a private event hosted privately by the dean, in his private residence, paid for out of his own pocket - to celebrate the law students (its meant for 1Ls, but those 1Ls started during covid so never got this ‚Äòwelcome‚Äô by their dean so they are doing it now) - bruh this is like someone protesting at someone‚Äôs private graduation party - its not about YOU üòÇ
I don‚Äôt think we know if university funds were used to pay for this. It seems like he put this event on by himself and invited people who are law students to attend. I don‚Äôt see anything that would say this was a university sanctioned event.
Give them a damn medal for showing assholes the door.¬†
Nope. Not a sponsored event and learn how the first amendment works.
on the other hand using a social event to further your political agenda is very scummy especially after targeting the dean with posters just because he is a jew
What genocide?

Not in private residence, you are allowed to use reasonable force to remove someone from your private property. Please do some basic reading on assault it‚Äôs 1L stuff my dude.

He does own his own home. He doesn't live in the law school you numnut.
This isn't the chancellor of the university and the Chancellor's House on campus. Chemerinsky is just dean of the law school and he lives in his own house off campus.
Umm he lives there it‚Äôs his house. You saying low income person living in government subsidized housing doesn‚Äôt get to call it their home? Whether it‚Äôs a student living in a dorm or a chancellor living on campus it‚Äôs their ‚Äúplace of residence‚Äù and do not deserve to be harassed.
‚ÄúThe house is privately owned by my wife and me. The mortgage is our names. It is on a street in Oakland. It is not owned by the university, on university property, or in any way paid for by the university,‚Äù Chemerinsky said in an interview with The Times. ‚ÄúIt is private property, and the 1st Amendment simply does not apply there. No one has the right to come into my house, or yours, and disrupt a dinner. As a matter of constitutional law, this is absolutely clear.‚Äù

Agreed.  What kind of example is this? You can't manhandle someone just because they are in your home.  You ask them to leave.  If they don't, call the police.  But don't jump them on the stairs.  It's not the wild, wild west.  

And I have yet to see footage of them asking her to leave *before* the professor put her hands on her.  If they didn't ask her first, then she had a right to be there.  Woman swooped in all handsy.   That was wrong. 

I can't shoot you in my home if I don't like you.  Or if you say something I don't like.   
 That's not how it works.  This woman wasn't a threat to them physically.  Even after hands were placed on her person, she didn't place hands back.   She just disagreed with them verbally. 

We are getting too accepting and used to violence.
A victim mentality helps no one
Who wrote this email and where did you see it? Can you shoot me a link/screenshot of the original?
These people as in muslims??? just a question. I also agree with the professor
Reddit was invented by a white capitalist exploiter. Guess you should log off permanently
And how is that relevant exactly? Because the protestor in the video said that their speech was protected by the first amendment, when in the that case it wasn‚Äôt.
wahhhhh wahhhh

Who needs to argue with terrorist supporters when they just prove how ignorant their statements are?

Castle doctrine does not apply here as there is no imminent physical threat to the safety of the homeowner. Calling the cops should have been their next action instead of accosting her which is assault. For 2 law professors they‚Äôre not the brightest bulbs in the chandelier. I hope she presses charges.
Even if it was sponsored. You‚Äôre telling me they don‚Äôt have the right to kick someone out of their own home? You must be a law student here¬†
Not a UC sponsored event. A tradition where the dean traditionally invites students for a dinner in his private home.
Can your company force you to rent out your house to the company for parties? No, because that is not in your contract.

State employees do not lose their property rights merely because they are employed by the state.

it it actually an undeniable historical fact that the most notable social change comes from the most disruptive protests. there is actually a whole uc berkeley class about it lol. So, I guess mouth-breathers are just correct? lol
>Total tuition and fees for the 3-year program are approximately $65,764.50 for CA residents or $111,070.50 for nonresidents.

Plus living expenses for 3 years in Berkeley, it's definitely costing you over 100K.

[Source](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/academics/doctoral-programs/jsd/tuition-financial-aid/cost-of-attendance/)
Correct! You're learning! **Not every time and place is the correct one for a protest.** 

Let's run through some examples to help:

Protesting outside a random synagogue -> bad place!

Standing outside the Israeli embassy -> good place!
Have you seen the posters they circulated before the dinners? Did you know they had been threatening the dean for weeks? Did you see the deans statement that he already told this group he expects their behavior would not be disruptive in his home? She was not invited to speak. She was invited to a private residence to attend a dinner. If she was uncomfortable eating with the dean she should not have come. Instead she brought a microphone and prepared a disruptive display and when asked to stop and leave, ignored those pleas, making her a trespasser. Stop defending stupid.
FTR I do not think she should have touched her, if nothing else it just gave this whole thing more attention, but I disagree with the peanut gallery that this was ""assault and battery"". I've watched the video (which has been cut and only shows 20 seconds of the entire event and only when the altercation is) and she clearly was just trying to take away the microphone and get her to leave her private residence. If she had pulled off her hijab or punched her in the face, I could see more validity to the ""assault"" argument.
You are actually allowed to lay hands on people
No, he owns his own home. It is not UC property. Source: Been there, know the dean.

It doesn't matter if you were previously invited if you've now been asked to leave. The video clearly says - ""I've asked you to leave"".
You can actually revoke consent at any time. A hard concept to grasp, I realize.
Lol.

This isn't assault. Maybe battery. But no one would take that seriously in a court of law considering the circumstance.

Are you another idiot law student or just the instagram comment peanut gallery?
[deleted]
To be honest, if you read California statute, using reasonable force to remove a trespasser is legal. There‚Äôs no assault. Come on
In the state of California you can use reasonable force to remove someone from your property when they are there without your consent. It‚Äôs not legally assault. A 3L should no better. Shame on Berkeley (any 1L professor) for failing this student so miserably.
Thanks!
wow, the students are terrorists.

Either cancel a dinner or we will ruin it for everyone.

Cultists.

Terrorists.

Probably on full scholarship while their families live on welfare.
man this whole thing is so bad faith. This """"""protest"""""" was entirely wrong and misguided (if you want to boycott, then boycott!! that's your protest!! maybe even have a separate event to really publicize it!), but it's so cynical and ridiculous to characterize any image of a Jewish person eating as inherently blood libel. The image described is clearly equating his support for zionism at a dinner as an offensive gesture in the face of mass starvation in Palestine under the zionist regime, not claiming he's eating Christian babies.¬†


It's one thing to expect this stupidity and antisocial bad faith from students or ideologues; there should be much higher standards for the fucking Dean of the Law School.
Thanks!
Was just wondering
Because if the students were invited to dinner as an University event, then first amendment might apply. Your can't ban someone from attending a university event for their opinions, because the University is a public entity.¬†


The smoking gun might be if the Dean charged the equipment rental and catering to the University or if he paid for it himself.
It's pretty obvious that hamas supporters are anti-semitic assholes.
He was targeted bc he's both the literal Dean of the Law School and a zionist lol, not bc he's Jewish. I'm as against this 'protest' as anyone-- and moreover freaking out over it; protest as you want but you *have* to expect pushback, and it's fair to remove someone from your literal home!--, but this is the kind of shitty misinformation that makes all us Jews look bad.


You don't have to make this look worse for those involved than it already is.
It's not because ""he's a jew."" Stop this manipulation. It's because he's insane or a liar, publicly stating that anti-zionism equals antisemitism.
Yeah that was kind of what tipped it for me! Like yes Prof Chemerinsky does have the typical Liberal 2-state solution perspective on Palestine. 

I also just felt this action was an act of grandstanding and that the posters are anti-semitic. I think is the students wanted to send a message to the Dean, organizing a boycott of the dinner would have been far more powerful than going and trying to read a speech.
""Interrupting a genocide"" lol. Yeah everyone who believes Israel shouldn't be destroyed is literally genociding right now
Jeez, and then you have the audacity to wonder why people might be hesitant or turned away from joining the movement
1. No genocide going on.
2. The jews didn‚Äôt kill 1400 German civilians and ignite a response. Nor did they fire rockets into German civilians hundreds of times before, forcing the germans to create an iron dome just to protect against the rockets
3. Don‚Äôt ever compare the Holocaust to this conflict. Disgusting. Maybe use China vs Vietnam instead, since the Chinese did kill a lot of Vietnamese then.
Yeah I don‚Äôt really use Reddit to talk about politics much because it doesn‚Äôt really lead to anything. I do activism in the real world via supporting BDS and attending protests.
I don't think it's confirmed that it's that's particular student put up the poster, but someone or a group put up posters.
Source on the anti semitic poster please?
‚Äútoo nice‚Äù lmao he supports free speech in name only and both he and Fisk have threatened to withhold academic credit from students in certain law journals on campus simply because the journals wanted to adopt a BDS statement

it‚Äôs totally one-sided
the job of modern news is to sow chaos and cause division
There was misinformation on Twitter as the OP described, but there‚Äôs also a lot of misinformation on this thread. I am not very familiar with the situation, but I read that she was invited to a campus event happening at her residence. As long as this was true, she was not trespassing.¬†
Jews are schrodingers whites, as in,  if being white is a good thing (like the nazis) we're the least white of the non whites but if being white is a bad thing (like modern leftists) were the whitest of the white.

Part of antisemitism is that it offers an outlet to exterbalize the worst thing currently onto the jews. That's why in communist countries jews were smeared capitalists and in capitalist countries vice versa
I know it's not, sadly. It's just so over the top.
That‚Äôs horrible!
Go away.
Yep.
What‚Äôs it matter
üíØ me too
It's crazy to readily admit that you would quite happily assault a woman.
Let's be real I remember being on campus in 2018, and it was all about how America needs to leave afghanistan still and then they left and I was just like wtf yall just letting the taliban rule? I guess fuck womens rights and abortion rights and pretty much what anyone has ever stood for.
True. But then, Palestine also isn‚Äôt supported by Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the list goes on and on.
""More than half a million people have been killed or seriously injured in two years of war in Ukraine, according to Western intelligence estimates ‚Äî a human toll not seen in Europe since World War II.""
Because of 500k people have been KIA'd or wounded and let's be real I feel 0 pain for the russians who are bleeding out in their trenches or getting shit on by fpv drones but once the israelis kill 500k palestinains or start launching 100s fab bombs a day on gaza let me know.
thanks for going to bat in this comment section! Pro-Palestine ‚â† Anti-semitic and Jewish person ‚â† Zionist
If that is what you got from what I wrote, then you are either willfully ignorant or unintelligent. Either way logic is not going to work with you.
Sure but a person gets more than 10 seconds before being physically assaulted, when they are speaking peacefully without any threat
i suppose you feel rational by commenting that on my post? its ok, I know you are one of the people championing this poor man's life just bc he died for a cause you think you know about.
[deleted]
Doing shit in public and then having it publicized is not being ‚Äúdoxxed.‚Äù
Keep your MBA and let the lawyers define the crimes. Assault does not even require physical contact.
To try to grab a protestor and take a phone out of their hand. Even if they're your guests and you have every right in the world, still gonna end up going viral and get punished.
You would first have the burden of proving this person is a trespasser. They are an invitee of the owner first, transformed into a trespasser at some point. Where does that line get drawn?

Secondly, did Prof Fisk use a reasonable amount of force to remove the trespasser? She probably used less than that, if that's even what she was trying to do. 

I'm not saying what Prof Fisk did is crime. I'm just saying it's unfortunate and kind of dumb bc it accomplished nothing while sending the social justice warriors into overdrive.
This event was a dinner for Berkeley law students. Aka, a UC event. as the Dean, when hosting a UC events at his home utilizing UC funds, he is bound to UC policies, which means this is basically a venue. This woman was an invited student who used this time to encourage uc divestment as a protest. Since October 7th most events or dinners I have attended have had a similar outcome 1 an Acknowledgement of what's going on so I really don't think it needs to be targeted however Dean chum has a history of comments threatening to sanction students for expressing support for Palestinian liberation. So that's a thing but if you find that to be normal behavior ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You think if a single protest doesn't immediately achieve it's aims then the protest was pointless?
The function of a protest is to be disruptive. This was a motion to divest in terms of funding, this dean and professor have both contributed to antipalestinian rhetoric and that is why the woman was protesting. Which if you read just a little more you will see. Also there was warning of a protest prior to the event happening but they ignored that.
It‚Äôs an opinion bud, just down vote and move along
Do less embarrassing thing‚Äôs?
It's not ""someone‚Äôs private graduation party,"" bruh, bro, bruh, bro, bruh, bro, duh
I'm not talking about the dinner itself. I don't think it matters. The only reason that he lives in Berkeley, owns that home, hosted that event, invited those students, is their relationship to a public university. It is inherently a public university event. These were not friends over for dinner.
UC pays for it making it a UC sponsored event
He‚Äôs a Zionist. There‚Äôs a difference.
Oh you know.. the one where 14,000+ children have been killed, the one with 17,000 children unaccompanied, the one with 900,000 children forcibly displaced, the one with there‚Äôs basically no access to proper medical care because they‚Äôre living under an occupation, the one where at least 27 kids were killed by starvation, the one where 33k+ people have been killed in 6 months, where 360,000 housing units have been destroyed by Israeli bombs, where 281,000 tons of carbon dioxide were emitted by Israel in the first 60 days, the one where women have to use tent scraps as pads, where 299,000 children under 5 are infected by infectious diseases malnutrition and dehydration.

Nah see islamists right to disrupt literally every single event even tangentially related to jews takes priority over jewish people being able to control their own property
You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm not a law student, and thank you for clarifying that. But it still doesn‚Äôt make it okay, she shouldn‚Äôt have put her hands on her. Like at all. Whether or not it was warranted, which it didn‚Äôt seem to be. The video also starts right before the attack, so I‚Äôd like to see what happened beforehand, because it seemed to escalate very quickly, and Fisk should have used better judgement. How are Muslim students supposed to feel safe on campus with professors doing that?
You can't physically grab them 5 seconds after you ask them to leave, and they are doing NOTHING threatening. That is battery.
Perhaps I should have clarified that I am not a professional lawyer or legal scholar, so my opinion on Chemerinsky is obviously based on my acquaintance with the aspects of his work that do touch on what I know about, which is economics and history, including a familiarity with more formal ways of doing jurisprudence, such as you can still find in so-called civil law countries. What I dislike in him really can be said to be a dislike with the way American law is carried on in general and the role that legal academics play in forming that law, which tends to be idiosyncratic (in a negative sense) and has negative economic consequences.

And, as you can see, my political orientation is quite opposite to Chemerinsky.
I live in the Upper West Side of Manhattan - one of the world's leading cultural and intellectual capitals, am a Ph.D. graduate of the University of Chicago - a school with a far greater record on academic freedom and free speech than Berkeley (in fact the literal opposite) and of equal intellectual prestige in the Social Sciences (and with a far superior Law School by the way).

Why would any one want the police called on a student? That makes no sense.
These people as in the delusional protestors.
I think they meant the protestors.
Bet they using an iPhone developed in Israel too.
It‚Äôs not assault to show someone the door
While you are right that PC198.5 she's but apply in this situation, it's still a trespass, and absolutely justified to use reasonable force.
I too hope she presses charges because the protester‚Äôs case will crumble like a sand castle
You are wrong on multiple fronts. First, if this didn‚Äôt occur in her own private property, touching the protestor as shown in the video would be battery, not assault. Second, the property owner has the right to use reasonable force to remove someone who refuses to leave their property. The protestor is simply a large but petulant child who hopefully will have difficulty passing the moral character examination.
Of course, they can kick someone out for trespassing. However, if it was an event which the university sponsored, you can't kick someone out for their politics. You can be innocent of one and guilty of the other, it's not an all or nothing case.


So he won't be charged for assault or battery or whatever, but the university can be charged for violating first amendment...probably? Should ask him about it, he seems like an expert.
I- I never said that .. üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
Even if it was sponsored. You can kick people out of your home at any time for any reason if they don‚Äôt live there¬†
In the past Dean Chemerinsky paid out of pocket for these events at his home
I dunno man, if it's a tradition for the head of the University's law school to host a dinner for his paying clients, the law students, it seems like it should be a UC event, especially if it's the tradition of the school? It's not like it's an impromptu gathering of friends and family.
It is an interesting question of fact - did UC pay for this event or not? Not that it changes my view of the ""protestors""
UC pays for it making it a UC sponsored event
UC Berkeley paid for the event. This is a UC Berkeley sanctioned dinner for UC Berkeley students hosted by a Dean and a professor at UC Berkeley. 

UC Berkeley should be ashamed and embarrassed by their racist behavior. 

UC Berkeley will be writing an enormous check to this young lady.
What threat is being posed to the property or the 2 people who own it?
its like a gay person standing up for HAMAS LOLLLLLLLZ
Everything short of genocide is justified when fighting genocide in their minds. Even genocide is justified to them if a Palestinian is doing it against an Israeli Zionist¬†
What?!?!?! You‚Äôre telling me that you didn‚Äôt demolish your own house to show solidarity???

/s
Don‚Äôt have to be. I and many others have infinitely more respect and will pay more attention to protestors on the side of the road with signs rather than knuckle-draggers gluing themselves to asphalt and throwing soup in museums.
If you are having a disruptive protest you should expect the people you are disrupting to try to disrupt you back. It‚Äôs infuriating how many people will do these things then act like they are being victimized for their religion or whatever.
Disruption is only one component. It‚Äôs not even close to the most important one either
I could shit my pants in class while screaming ‚Äúfree Palestine‚Äù and that would be super disruptive - but at the end of the day I‚Äôd look stupid like these protestors because all people would see is ‚Äúlmao he shit his pants‚Äù
Trust me, everyone is aware of the situation in Gaza. You don't need to continue ""raising awareness"" by targeting Jewish professors through Third Reich esque  ""Zionist"" posters about them and protesting against Israel at their homes. It just makes you all look like antisemitic assholes.
Sorry but your Jew-hater stuff ain't it.  The Dean is only being targeted for his religion and nothing else. Cut it out.
Can you name a historical instance where a protest inside somebody‚Äôs private residence stopped a conflict in an entirely different country?
This demonstrates a gross lack of critical thinking
Ok so what is the point I am supposed to see this societal change?

What is your timeline here?

Just constantly saying ""pRoTesTinG iS meAnT To Be uNcomForTabLe"" doesn't actually tell me anything about WHEN things are supposed to happen does it?
That's apparently the JSD program. Same site shows more than 50K per year just in tuition for the JD program. 

If no aid, I think a typical California resident would expect to pay more than 150K just in tuition. Probably  225K+ with reasonable living expenses for the whole 3 years. 

I've never heard of a JSD program before. Apparently it's an academic as opposed to professional program. I don't know how common it is at Berkeley law.
since when was chemerinsky‚Äôs house a random synagogue
***woosh***
She left didn't she? Cops weren't even necessary. It does not make her a ""trespasser"" since she didn't trespass. It makes her a now unwanted guest who left soon after, but not before being assaulted first. Now the Dean is threatening to report to the Bar so you can't get a job, all for speaking out your thoughts. That's an embarrassment to all Berkeley students and alumni.
I mean, assault is a low bar. You aren't allowed to physically force yourself on people outside of self defence, which this was not. It's not like crazy but it she was 100% in the wrong touching the student, trying to take her phone, etc. The husband was the cooler head, just using words.
... You aren't though? Only in self defence, which this is not.
>Lol.

>Are you another idiot law student?

>This isn't assault. Maybe battery. But no one would take that seriously in a court of law considering the circumstance.

You're right, its assault AND battery, going hands-on in an attacking manner with another person, without warning. What else would you call this?

Do you automatically start insulting the other person in every conversation you have? That's just the kind of person you are, I suppose.
Did she warn her beforehand?

>Unwanted person, in her private property. Her home.

she was *invited*. [Then assaulted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelCrimes/comments/1c0hqmp/the_uc_berkeley_law_professor_assaults_a/)

yikes, racist much?
If you look up other ""blood libel"" cartoons - you can see the similarities for yourself and I doubt it was an accident. But even the implication that the Jewish dean of the law school is directly a cause for Gazan suffering and should be protested/boycotted.. is interesting.

Yes, he has said he is a ""Zionist"", which he defines as ""supports the existence of Israel, although he condemns many of its policies"". Seems pretty balanced to me?  But not good enough for you, so now he can't a host a dinner? It isn't an IDF fundraiser. It wasn't for Jewish/Zionist students only. It was open to all and simply a dinner to build community.

These events have been happening for months and he has been **extremely tolerant** of statements and conduct right on the line of overtly antisemitic even as alumni and current students have complained to him. 

So what exactly do you think he should be doing better?
He 100% charged it. They weren‚Äôt banned for their beliefs though, they were banned for bringing a microphone and disrupting the event, which was a dinner.
Berkeley Law has a rich history of skirting the line of anti-semitism from LSJP and he has mostly allowed the gray area as a staunch free speech advocate. Taking it into his home was a step too far.
Because he wouldn't bar Israeli people from speaking at Berkeley?  At least be honest that you hate the First Amendment.  It will make dismissing you easier.
What makes him a Zionist? Is he Israeli? Does he have property in the West Bank? Did he join the IDF? Or is he an American who has ideas you disagree with and find problematic?
Stop pretending ""Zionist"" means anything other than Jew right now
So he's being targeted because he doesn't want Israel completely dismantled? Do they think they can protest him out of his personal opinion?
Anti zionism is anti semitism, the belief that jews should not have a homeland/safety and that Israelis should be eradicated is anti semitism
He did not say this. This is exactly the sort of behavior that is problematic. You‚Äôre preemptively excusing antisemitism by saying it is merely antizionism, but Chemerinsky never made the claim that the two are equivalent which you are arguing against.
One student brought up not divestment by from companies in Israel . But as Chemerinsky said he has no control over that. He‚Äôs a dean of the law school. Carol Christ the chancellor has control over that. So blaiming him like he‚Äôs the school and makes all the decisions doesn‚Äôt make sense. If the goal is to make Berkeley divest from companies in Israel a protest or boycott of the chancellor who actually has influence of that would make more sense. It can be done. Just recently in 2019 The University of California system cut over 150 million from its  its investment in fossil fuels. I think the strategy these people are doing just isn‚Äôt working. When protesting you need organization and planning. 


Are you bringing attention to a cause that doesn‚Äôt have it . In this case I don‚Äôt think so as what‚Äôs happening in Gaza is world news unlike Sudan or Mayanmar? So bringing attention seems like a secondary goal over the divestment goal of the group .Does your protest have a specific goal? In this case divestment I guess. Does protesting at that specific location or group helps forward your goal? In this case no as the law dean doesn‚Äôt have the power to make that decision. Why are you protesting this specific group or person? What makes Cherminsky‚Äôs house specifically a target of protest? I haven‚Äôt heard of any extremely controversial statments or actions he‚Äôs taken but I could be uninformed. And did the action help your cause. I don‚Äôt think so as it being on private property and being asked to leave made it more complicated and now gets their group portrayed as trespassers in the media . The fact she‚Äôs using free speech as a defense against the private property against Chemerinsky of all people makes her look less knowledgeable of the law and likely hurts her possible connections in a future of law that she could use for her cause if she chose to.

Any protest has to be organized and planned . The civil rights movement had years of planning and test beforehand. They targets specific places and chose forms of protest that would get the best results. They didn‚Äôt just walk up to a restaurant and sit down. They had test beforehand to be prepared. They targeted specific segregated restaurants or ones known in the community to get the most attention . They also fought with the law and courts. Just look at the bus boycott. E. D. Nixon, president of the local NAACP chapter and a member of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters planned test cases for arresting .Rosa Parks action brought attention to bussing and segregation.The civil rights movement targeted bussing as it was segregated. By boycotting busses they seriously harmed the economy of Montgomery. They organized with black taxi drivers and sharing cars. They had 3 demands courteous treatment by bus operators, 2) passengers seated on a first-come, first-served basis, with black people seated in the back half and white people seated in the front half, and 3) black people would be employed as bus operators on routes predominately taken by black people. Kings time in jail was used to give the movement national attention and change the narrative. They then won a court victory. I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs only one way to protest but when you protest you need to plan and organize in a way that helps your goal best. This clearly didn‚Äôt seem to be done with this case.

What I‚Äôm saying is that any protest needs planning organization and goals and this didn‚Äôt seem well planned or thought out.  They didn‚Äôt seem to have the proper target to enhance their goal as Cherminskey doesn‚Äôt control divestment , from what I‚Äôve seen  on the news and social media it didn‚Äôt help them with public opinion , and the organization didn‚Äôt seem planned long term as they changed their goal. The student  even claiming SA from the professor which regardless of how someone might claim assault I don‚Äôt think that will hold up as well.Originally they told people not to attend the dinner and then when it continued decided to switch course and attend to protest. But I think the result of this will actually harm their cause more than help it due to the poster controversy, the private property issues , and media portrayal but we will see.
The people creating [kill zones](https://archive.ph/WjvE0) are. [A military that conducts itself like this](https://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf) might be committing genocide. 

What about the destruction of Palestine? Do they not matter? Are they people to be continually bombed and oppressed [under brutal military occupation](https://youtu.be/7ayiO1Gl6lo?si=Eq-wkgtkKFr4TwaB)?

Are US citizens that are against the [literally criminal Israel lobby](https://youtu.be/3lSjXhMUVKE?si=K23Pp1h-Ld5P_prc) among the people you‚Äôre referring to?

What would make it a genocide to you? Apparently the starving and killing of thousands of children isn‚Äôt doing it for you. How long should people tolerate ‚Äúkill zones‚Äù do they have those in your neighborhood?

It is newsworthy.  I didn‚Äôt see it but apparently CNN ran it last night .
She was trespassing as soon as she was asked to leave and didn't. Just like a business is open to the public, but once you are asked to leave, you have to leave or it is trespassing.
She was asked to leave and did not. The second you do that you are trespassing. Being invited somewhere doesn‚Äôt give you permanent access to do whatever you want there
Oh yes, agreed. Just pointing out that here, she didn‚Äôt have any cover of whiteness. These people were attacked for being Jews.
It‚Äôs so funny how there isn‚Äôt a response to my question. Like now we can‚Äôt call a person racist because what if they‚Äôre Jewish, oh no! It‚Äôs almost like if someone behaves in a racist way, then they are a racist, and being Jewish doesn‚Äôt mean you can be racist with impunity. Like what a weird concept that you can‚Äôt call a Jewish person racist, as being Jewish is a choice anyone can make, people of all races convert every day. So bffr
Wow.

I‚Äôm not trying to be argumentative; just to make sense of this. Do you have any idea why she was invited to a dinner for 3Ls? Because according to Wikipedia, she got a J.D. from NYU in 2002.  Would she have been seeking an advanced law degree at Berkeley?
[deleted]
incel.
If someone decided to do some performative narcissism in my home, they get asked once to leave and after that, it‚Äôs all on the table.¬†
Yeah.. I think people in the west just can‚Äôt grasp that there are really bad societies and cultures in the world, democracy is so fragile and western people don‚Äôt appreciate it enough.
It's pretty dishonest to compare casualties of combatants across two sides in a war to civilian deaths. Most of your number is the 'seriously injured' category, and is filled by soldiers. Murdering civilians is entirely incomparable, and is happening, again, at *minimum* 1200% the rate in Palestine.


But you seem to have missed the point: there's something deeply sick with a person who only feels sympathy to one massacre and not another. I'm glad you don't actually go to Berkeley, since it would devalue my degree so greatly!
Doxxing is not an appropriate consequence.
[deleted]
I'm aware of the difference between battery and assault, but labeling that as an ""assault"" is a clearly meant to rile up the dumdums who are looking for any reason to throw a hissy fit.
> let the lawyers define the crimes.

is actually part of the problem. for example, it's why no one knows if bumping someone in the protection of their own personal space is legal or not. (as seen in antifa or pro-palestine protests where antifa et. al., crowd into a person's path and deny them access to the space but call foul if that person touches them)

lawyers should not be defining the crimes.

the legislators should after hearing from the public.
Why were they on his property? 

I would do anything to protect myself from people supporting terrorists on my property
I hear what you are saying, but I also think it's good to stand up, even physically, to bullies (and trespassers).

I think these idiots get away with it because they've been getting away with it. Everyone is so passive and finds ways to make excuses.
'social justice warriors'

Do people still use this phrase?
The same professor who let anti- semetic posters remain of himself up as the school? He has been a champion of first amendment rights for eveyone.
They‚Äôve been pulling constant stunts like this for months. Palestine will not be ‚Äúfreed‚Äù through performative bullshit. It‚Äôs just pushing people away from their cause because they are so extreme and annoying. And targeting your Jewish dean does nothing but make you look like antisemitic assholes
>there was warning of a protest prior to the event happening but they ignored that.

What do you expect him to do? You don't get to threaten the **DEAN OF THE SCHOOL** to not host a dinner **OR ELSE** and have them bend to your demands. He responded to the threat saying he expects any form of protest to **not be disruptive**. They went to the event, and chose to be disruptive anyway. He has every right to get them disciplinary action or report them to the California bar. If you have followed these events over the past few months he has been **very** permissive of protest and offensive speech - he is a famous scholar of constitutional law and free speech! But future lawyers should know, ""freedom of speech"" doesn't mean ""I can say whatever I want, wherever and whenever I want with no consequences""
How have they contributed to anti Palestinian rhetoric? What specifically made them good targets for protest?
Are you actually ‚Äúreading‚Äù or just getting your talking points from tik tok. Did you read his statements and think critically about what he was saying or did you just watch a clip of somebody regurgitating some words. 

What was this anti Palestinian rhetoric they were spouting?
Oh so when the professor said to the protestor ‚Äúwe agree with you about Palestine ‚Äú was that an example of that?  The Professor also said (oarafrasing) that the law school wasn‚Äôt involved in divestment and there was nothing they could do.  This is all on the extended recording of the event.
okay. okay. you‚Äôre right. sorry - i love berkeley so was feeling a little ‚Äúhurt.‚Äù won‚Äôt downvote you, though.
was the protest embarrassing or the response to it or both?
 Way to add to the discussion my guy ü§ù great quip, so edgy. Im about to explode from your edging üí¶
legally I think they were. If you invite your coworkers to your house for dinner is that work event? Not necessarily.
Do you care if what you say is true or not?
It‚Äôs a private dinner in someone‚Äôs home. You‚Äôre spewing nonsense
Is he a zionist or are you just an antisemite, even after he refused to let the posters targeting him be taken down because he believed it was their 1a right. Mic drop üé§
That still isn‚Äôt a genocide.  What definition are you looking at?

Also where are you getting these numbers for children killed and unaccompanied?
US killed more than 37,000 in the Hamburg bombings alone in WW2, and that ain't close to a genocide.

It's really weird how ppl think they can come up with their own, completely wrong definitions of genocide. And screaming it over and over again is somehow supposed to help their argument.

Now the indiscriminate mass murder and rape on 10/7 thats much, much closer to the legal definition of genocide.
Check out this: ¬†fucking go home if you can‚Äôt be civilized.¬†
The problem is, Zionists want to steal, control, occupy others' property. That's the heart of the matter.
> Muslim students supposed to feel safe on campus with professors doing that?

So she should be able to disrupt a private event(Yes the dinner is a private event), and someone elses private property, and expect to not be removed?

Sometimes my jaw drops at the sheer audacity of some of these protestors statements.
How are jews supposed to feel safe with Arab supremacists and islamists disrupting literally every single facet of their lives, including on their own property? You have got to br kidding.
 There are 60 witnesses who are free to come forward and provide statements that then say it was excessive, then the protesters can contact police and file a report. It wont happen because, your feelings dont dictate how the law reads or is applied. If i invite someone into my private home and i asked them to leave and they refuse, i will contact the police after asking them to leave and escorting them to the door using reasonable means/force. Thats the appropriate way to handle this - stop white knighting others simply because of the ‚Äúoptics‚Äù.

I just realized how futile this is, we are having a feelings argument over the law. That isnt how it works, the real word has gravity to it.
No it‚Äôs not, bro go read the statutes. Private property, reasonable means/force. They can file police charges if they feel it‚Äôs different. Here‚Äôs a hint - they wont.
interesting, thanks, that's quite a reading list.

Did they remain after being asked to leave?
If you‚Äôre asked to leave and don‚Äôt that is trespassing on private property.
Why didn‚Äôt they leave the property?
> we know all you do is attack the messanger because you have no valid moral or legal argument.

I literally linked you to the legal argument (which is based on the moral argument)
[deleted]
Holy shit you‚Äôre a lost cause. What are you trying to say? Anybody whose residence is somebody else property deserves to be harassed? Low income housing is also public housing, a renter‚Äôs home is the landlord‚Äôs property not the renters. Student housing is also owned by the university.

Why in your mind does it matter that it‚Äôs public vs private housing? Bc you think student tuition pays for his housing (which is a tenuous connection at best, it‚Äôs most likely from trusts and donations), they should have the right to demonstrate in his home? 

So by that logic since I‚Äôm paying taxes I should be able to  harass anybody who lives in low income public housing since I‚Äôm ‚Äúpaying for it‚Äù. Or since I own a rental unit and pay for the repairs, the mortgage etc, I should be able to come and harass my tenants

And Cherminsky actually does pay for his housing, by working as the Dean. Just as you and I ‚Äúpay‚Äù with our time and labor for the ability to generate income and housing.
He literally does own his home though.
‚ÄúThe house is privately owned by my wife and me. The mortgage is our names. It is on a street in Oakland. It is not owned by the university, on university property, or in any way paid for by the university,‚Äù Chemerinsky said in an interview with The Times.
I mean you're a destiny fanboy. Someone who is famous for getting banned from twitch for saying people should run over BLM protesters, saying they hate all muslims under the guise of hating ""all religion,"" getting dumpstered by Finkelstein and Rabbani, and hanging out with Nick Fuentes 

lmfao.
So now Reddit can‚Äôt have new accounts? 

Why don‚Äôt you answer the question that was asked.
 I dont understand all this grandstanding - if you dont want to go. Then dont. But if this is what throws you about a law program‚Ä¶ maybe you dont belong in that profession. The law isn‚Äôt about your feelings, it‚Äôs about evidence and facts.
Cool! Enjoy ü§ù
I know exactly what it is. And it‚Äôs still a towel used to demean women. Join the 21st century, savage.¬†
Had she done that without touching her, there would be no issue. Prof Fisk did, after all, invite her to her home so she is not considered an intruder.
Battery is still a crime, regardless of whether it occurs on public or private property. There was no imminent threat to the safety of either of the homeowners, just some unwanted speech on the part of their guests. I think it is a bit premature to assume that they won‚Äôt pass the moral character examination as that would be up to the appropriate state bar association to determine.
Look up viewpoint neutral restrictions at a nonpublic forum and get back to us.

You do not have the right to just grab the mic at UCB commencement, even though that is a university event on university property. You will be immediately trespassed and removed from the campus.

Its an even further stretch to claim you can do that on someone else's private property simply based on their association with the university.
Well the ‚Äúright to engage in free speech‚Äù kinda implies she should have not been kicked out. She dosnt have that right in someone‚Äôs home. Sponsored or not.¬†
What are you saying then?
Why are you stuttering over text
To paraphrase Anatole France: the law, in its majestic equality, protects rich and poor alike from having their political events disrupted so long as they host them on their own private property.
It's his tradition. Not the school's tradition. He pays out of pocket at his private residence.
Not that it matters, but do you have proof that UC pays for it?
Lol. Chemerinsky wrote the book on Constitutional Law. Literally. 

No serious scholar has said that the First Amendment allows the state to override its employees private property rights.

Berkeley‚Äôs involvement here simply doesn‚Äôt matter, because their involvement cannot alter said rights. Chemerinsky is not obligated to invite students to his house. 

If Chemerisnky presses charges, she will be convicted of trespass.
The presence of intruders.
Diagnosis twinning
That's funny, since the ones glueing themselves to the ground make a lot more noise on the news, I end up paying much more attention to them, a perfect example would be the January 6th protesters, and the ""Jews will not replace us"" lowers, I heard a lot about them compared to anyone else. Racism and violence are very attention grabbing I guess.
Exactly. Do they expect the homeowners to welcome them in their homes and hand them hors d'oeuvres?
No, it is actually the most important. If you ever have the opportunity, consider taking Sociol 141. It is a whole course dedicated to comparing and analyzing protests, including pointing out what the most effective forms of protesting are.
I mean, they're not far off from that. Did you see the unc tampon 911 call? Absolutely hilarious
I think if you thought about it for more than two seconds you would know that is not a good example. That disrupts a class... not anywhere that would cause mass social disruption. The most effective ones are the ones that disrupt society the most. For example, the only reason we have handicap accessibility is because of a disruptive protest in an SF govt building that pushed lawmakers to increase accessibility. I'm not saying that the person who protested at this professor's house was necessarily strategic in their protesting. I'm just replying to a comment that tried to diminish the impact of disruption.
It is not that this makes them look this way, they are this way.
I am actually shocked how few people have any awareness of what is unfolding or have little interest or if they know say things like, it‚Äôs not our problem m, I don‚Äôt really understand it all.
.
Oh wow you're right my bad. Tuition has gone up a lot since I went.
I'm simply giving an example of **how there are bad times and places to protest.** 

In the case of Chem's house, they say the reason they protested is because they were unhappy about the law school's investments. Instead of protesting on the public law school campus, they instead harassed and threatened the Jewish dean about him hosting private dinners at his home for weeks. He told them before they arrived he told them the expectation was that any form of protest would be non-disruptive. They decided to be disruptive anyway in his private residence. He asked them to leave, they refused and continued their stunt, so they were then trespassing. It's extremely unprofessional behavior, and they are clearly not going to make it as lawyers where composure and professionalism are key expectations. So they risked their degree, student status, and future career for what exactly?
She did not leave when asked. She fought with them, tried to continue her disruption, and told them to ""call the cops""
Incorrect. You may use reasonable force to remove a trespasser who refuses to leave.
That‚Äôs exactly what I meant in self defense
Ok so the peanut gallery, got it.
just because you link a thread from **ISRAEL CRIMES** that says ""assault"" doesn't make it assault. clearly Berkeley failed to educate you.
[deleted]
If you ever go to some basic law classes, like property, you know permissions to enter and stay in someone‚Äôs property can be revoked at any time.

Edit: sorry, I mean property, not torts.
This might be a hard concept for hamas loving gang rape supporters to understand but one can revoke consent at any time
Wrong, she was originally invited, and asked to leave 20-30 times before the video actually started, at which point she was already a trespasser. Technically no she wasn‚Äôt assaulted since assault requires ‚Äúimminent apprehension‚Äù of a battery, here, she wasn‚Äôt aware until she was actually touched, meaning she wasn‚Äôt in any apprehension of the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù until it was already completed . The reason it‚Äôs not actually a battery here is because of the speaker‚Äôs status as a trespasser and the wife‚Äôs legal right to use proportional force as a response.
There will not be a jury trial. This is absolutely allowed and summary judgment will be the result, if ever any lawyer is willing to even take on the case.
I am still confused about your claim of assault. Seems like you do not even know what that word means
your parents must've called you dumb
Dunce cap award üß¢
Pertaining to what race? White people?
Not mischaracterize a literal cartoon made by people who have already more than abundantly shown their asses? They already look like fools, no need to lie in the mud with them and throw shit like a monkey. He's a Dean, it's fair to expect better of him. And yes, I know what blood libel is and what it is depicted as; not every image that has elements of a thing is that thing, especially when there's a very clear and more reasonable alternative explanation.
I will quote my comment:¬†


>I'm as against this 'protest' as anyone


I'm confused if you didn't read my comment, or didn't care. They shouldn't have done what they did; Chemerinsky should be intelligent and respectful enough to not intentionally mischaracterize the cartoon leading up to the as an example of blood libel. Both things can be true, and it is certainly true that it is intellectually bankrupt and harmful to all of us Jews to cry wolf over things that literally incited pogroms.
lol I'm not here to argue with someone who just comments to fling shit. He believes that it is antisemitic to oppose israel (literally saying so in his LA Times op-ed), and that's definitionally zionist.


You don't care because you want to speak over Jews-- which really makes you think.........
He supports in thought the continued existence of the state of Israel in some form, which is one of the definitions of ""Zionist"".   
He also would like to tolerate the presence of Israeli speakers etc. at UC Berkeley, so he ""advocates giving a platform to Zionists"".
Yes, to antisemites it does. Or do I have to turn in my Jew card since I'm an anti-zionist?
>¬†I'm as against this 'protest' as anyone


Can you read? Hasbara doesn't even give you literacy programs these days??
It's definitely a natural step from saying a race shouldn't have its own settler state to saying it should be exterminated! Very normal!¬†


Do you think Black Americans should have their own country, and that it would be fair to expel all white and other people from the Southern USA (or at minimum steal their land, kill their kids, and disenfranchise them from political and social power)? Because by your argument, if you say no you're calling for the extermination of black people¬†
Are you schizophrenic? Cuz you're fighting against an imaginary argument I never made. 

What I said was it's not genocidal to be against the eradication of Israel.
And that‚Äôs the cleaned up version. Apparently they had a version with bloody fork and knives that they put up but took down due to backlash
Ah that makes sense
White supremacy and racism are different things.

White supremacists, at least in America, are sort of famous for disliking Jewish people.
Oh, sorry--the woman in the picture is not Saira Rao.  I was (or thought I was) responding to a comment that quoted one of Saira Rao's tweets.
Front yard back yard who cares. That chick was private property running her mouth about some blood libel nonsense and then acts as if her hijab was completely pulled off or something lmaoooo
What does it matter that they're ""combatants"" when they're drafted? 

Ironically *you* have missed the point. It being sick to only care about one massacre was that commenters whole point lmao. You're downplaying the massacre of Ukrainians by calling them ""soldiers"" when in reality they are random people forced to defend their country. 

Why do you say I'm not a Berkeley student? Is it cope that you're getting downvoted so hard?
Eh literally zero people believe the casualty numbers coming out of Hamas.

Considering they bombed their own hospital, blamed israel, and reported 500 dead instead of 20, divide the 'reported' deaths by at least 20.
[deleted]
Right, it probably doesn't rise to assault because there is no apprehension of injury or harm. The protester really didn't look all that bothered other than saying please don't touch me. Even so, unwanted touching isn't a good look for a university professor, even in their own home.  Not a crime, but the university may decide to punish her for some violation of faculty conduct.
In what way was Prof. Fisk protecting herself? Again, Chemerinsky is fine, he's just talking. 

Doing ""anything"" to ""protect"" yourself on your property could be a crime. This ain't Florida
Agreed. Would have been hilarious if she dragged her ass to the sidewalk by her hijab and shrugged to the camera, ""reasonable force?""
What about the posters were antisemitic?
clearly not anymore.
This was a Berkeley dinner he is a Dean this is a conversation of uc divestment.... this is pretty simple to understand
Janet you could google or research yourself, seeing as you've already assumed that I don't. Why would you ask me....
The protest but it‚Äôs the staffs fault.
The response is repugnant, apologizing to Chemerinsky and his wife who assaulted the speaker!
Your words
This wasn't coworkers. This was the Dean of Law at the top Public University in the world, with law students of same university. They have no other relationship.
> Is he a zionist 

Not that it matters when people are doing a protest literally in his backyard, but yeah. When a bunch of student groups banned Zionists from visiting, he considered himself banned too
open your eyes and think for yourself dont believe everything you see online
Genocide is when carbon dioxide is emitted.
Not you being a genocide denier üò≥. Sources are from USCPR and defense for children international Palestine
Sooo since 33k+ and 14k+ children killed is such a small number to you, the 1200 Israelis killed is nothing right?
Or does one group of people‚Äôs lives matter more than the other to you? You‚Äôre also proposing that there is no indiscriminate bombing in Gaza, meaning every bomb is deliberate and aimed precisely, admitting that the IOF killed 14,000 children and counting on purpose‚Ä¶ and there have been dozens of documented cases of the IOF raping children and women (men too probably). Have you heard about the 13 yr old gang raped by the IOF so brutally she had to get stitched up? Her father had to carry her to the nearest hospital. You‚Äôre speaking from a very uneducated place.
Ah yes, because posting meme = uncivilized. Get fucked HA
You have lost your mind, nutjob.
Just because someone interrupts something doesn‚Äôt give someone an excuse to put their hands on them and get physical‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not excusing how the student interrupted the private event. They had a right to feel frustrated with her. But you people are literally defending a person in power assaulting a student, wtf?
Did you see the video, BRO?
No problem.
You're clearly incapable. Which is why you go to a school legendary for its violent attacks on free speech.
Fisk's arm was around the student's neck within about 10 seconds of Chemerinsky saying, ""Please leave."" The student was doing nothing threatening. This is unreasonable time to leave and unreasonable force.
When was she asked to leave?[ When she was assaulted?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelCrimes/comments/1c0hqmp/the_uc_berkeley_law_professor_assaults_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) She was invited. The video is clear.

Holy shit you‚Äôre right lmao. Even Chancellor Christ lives in her own home (she declined campus housing). Why are people trying to dehumanize the ‚Äúother side‚Äù like this to justify their actions. Mofo definitely got his talking point from tik tok
lol. lmao even. Destiny is a cuck who abandoned his kid to have meaningless sex with mentally ill women. Cope and seethe, Jew hater.
After you‚Äôve been asked to leave you‚Äôre an intruder.
Are you kidding? If you invite someone to your home you are not allowed to kick them out?
So I can come into your home and start screaming, but unless I pose a imminent threat to your safety you just have to let me do my thing?
If you think any prosecutor is charging this as battery, it is time for you to quit smoking crack. And yes, I think this person should have a hard time passing the moral character examination‚Ä¶
LOL that went right over your head ‚Ä¶
My dude, there is a whole lot to unpack here.¬†¬†


Did he use official channels to disseminate this event? How were the guests registered? Did he start doing this before he became a professor, or did he start this in his position as the Dean of the law school?¬†


I understand that if he retired, then reached out personally to graduates he had a rapport with, that would be a personal and private event.¬†But in his current role as the head of the school, inviting every currently graduating student, possibly through the school listserv? Not so sure. Definitely a grey zone at least, the sort of thing HR warns you about, and something a legal mind might be able to articulate and give useful points and counterpoints about.


But to so blithely dismiss it with ""it's his tradition, not the school's"" without examination? I see that you wasted your 100k too.
Lmao no they don‚Äôt. Of course they don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre just saying stupid shit on the internet to prove an idiotic point they made up in their head. It‚Äôs beyond dumb
You‚Äôre a clown ü§° 

Chemerinsky is not clown and will not press charges as there was no crime. 

Unfortunately for UC Berkeley, two employees tried to stifle protected speech at a UC Berkeley sponsored event. UC Berkeley will lose.
What threat of physical/bodily harm are the property owners defending against?
OMG they were invited guests. They did nothing threatening. Fisk‚Äôs arm was around the student‚Äôs neck within ten seconds of Chemerinsky saying, ‚ÄúPlease leave.‚Äù Unreasonable time to respond and unreasonable force.
Sure but it‚Äôs negative attention, and no news is good news. Hand gluers, soup throwers, J6‚Äôers, and Jew haters fail to enact policy and will continue to be the butt of the joke, not only because of their goals but also because of how they present themselves (idiotic)
I‚Äôve organized professionally for over 20 years. I‚Äôve guest lectured graduate level organizing classes at prestigious universities. It‚Äôs absolutely not the most important part. 90% of an action is in the strategy around it and the broader campaign. It‚Äôs about the tactics, turnout and power analysis. Being disruptive is often a component, but it‚Äôs more about who you disrupt, how you do it, and with what lasting power and plan vs just being disruptive.
Idk if Laleh would think this is even a good example of protesting though.
It‚Äôs important if you want to quickly lose public favor
I must‚Äôve missed that one, could‚Äôve sworn that was Vanderbilt. Or maybe it was both lol
The toxic shock one where they were ‚Äúdenied‚Äù medical attention
why are you assuming that what the protesters had issue with was his jewish identity rather than his direct influence on the law school‚Äôs investments as a prominent decision-maker at the university? who gets to determine whether or not a protest is disruptive? furthermore, what even is a non-disruptive protest? and finally, why is your priority for a career in law professionalism rather than making an impact on the state of world affairs- or, in the microcosm of this conflict between students and the university, your own community?

don‚Äôt pretend that a dean‚Äôs house is the same thing as a synagogue in terms of cultural significance to conflate anti-zionism with anti-semitism, that‚Äôs just ridiculous
No? Literally dude quotes it in op, you need to be threatened to use force. Otherwise just wait for the cops.
Ok, so insults, got it. That's all you guys have. Your amorality is so naked. You have no other leg to stand on, and *it shows.*
lol k. We will see.
Even as you're being assaulted? Also, love how you zionists are unable to have a conversation without insulting people. Really shows who you are.
Where‚Äôd you get your law degree? Stanford? Lmfao

Not every cartoon about a Jew is blood libel, but many of them are: [https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitism-arab-cartoons-during-israel-hamas-war-chronology-dehumanization-jews](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitism-arab-cartoons-during-israel-hamas-war-chronology-dehumanization-jews)

And perhaps they invoked this imagery naively, but it's on them to apologize and learn if they want to claim that their activism isn't anti-semitic. Spoiler alert, they won't.
From the Chemerinsky op-ed you're talking about: [""criticism of the Israeli government is not antisemitism""](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-10-29/antisemitism-college-campus-israel-hamas-palestine)

Way to mischaracterize the dean's position.
No he says it is anti-semitic to say Israel needs to be destroyed. 

The fact you people keep basically saying ""destroy Israel"", but then when called out on it try to reframe it as ""criticism"" of the Israeli government is such bullshit. 

You people either need to admit you are being anti-semitic or just accept Israel exists. Not a hard choice to me.
You‚Äôre an antisemite. Just admit it. It‚Äôs okay you‚Äôre allowed to be one!
Saying the only Jewish nation on the planet needs to be destroyed is anti semitic. 

So yes
You can be a Jew and be antisemitic. You‚Äôre an example of that.
You're as jewish as [max naumann](https://www.jta.org/archive/dr-max-naumann-still-loyal-to-nazi-oppressors-of-his-race-hits-zionists-and-eastern-jews) and the [yevesketsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevsektsiya?wprov=sfla1)

lmao. U still missed the 'it's psychotic to care about one death and not a way higher rate (or hell, a way lower rate!!) of another' part, but idc. I'm actually a Ukrainian Jew so my opinion on this isn't liable to be swayed by a freak cosplaying as a college student
man, even the CIA and Pentagon have repeatedly said the Gazan Health Ministry is the most accurate and entirely reliable for death numbers. I know propaganda moves fast, but even the guys who started the lie have moved on at this point-- catch up!
Ha, calling someone a criminal who hasn't been charged or gone to trial is so stupid, I hope you're not an actual law student.
Not a great look but the university would never punish her in anyway. Let's be serious here, it's her home and she's asking them to leave.
She was clearly bothered, I worry for women in your life if you can't clearly discern concern.
Seems like dangerous trespassers supporting terrorism were on their property
>Doing ""anything"" to ""protect"" yourself on your property could be a crime.

Yes but in this case the Professor fisk was well within reasonable force
why by her hijab? I hope that wasn't your intent but comes across a bit racist.
Have you seen them?
Oh are you saying that you know more then the leading law professor in the country?  How so?

Oh wait the National lawyers guild said it was ok. Come on.

This hurts real Islamophobia and sexual assault victims.
He is a Dean.  He isn‚Äôt the chancellor.
Got it you have no proof. I thought so

And I love how people use my username to respond like it‚Äôs some big ‚Äúown‚Äù. Obviously you don‚Äôt know who Janet Yellen is.
what could the staff have done differently?
ü•±
Legally I don‚Äôt see any difference, if it wasn‚Äôt paid for or hosted by the university. It‚Äôs not a public event.
Did you know that criticizing someone‚Äôs support of Israel doesn‚Äôt make that person antisemitic. üò≥ His reaction tells me everything I need to know.
Genocide is the intentional killing of a large number of a group of non-combatants. That stat emphasizes the amount of bombs that the IOF has dropped to ya know‚Ä¶ intentionally kill a lot of people
Are they reliable?  If I asked for the names of all those kids would they be able to produce them?

Why do you trust them?
Link the proof
When someone is trespassing on your property (as this student was) you may use reasonable force to remove them. That is the law. You may not like that, but Fisk did nothing wrong.  The student should be embarrassed that she doesn‚Äôt know anything about first amendment jurisprudence. 

Now I understand you to be saying that, regardless of the law, what Fisk did was somehow morally wrong. I think you‚Äôre again wrong. But I hope you‚Äôll genuinely consider this: what if a student who is concerned about the hostages held by Hamas went to the Muslim student center with a megaphone and kept screaming ‚Äúfree the hostages!‚Äù Do you think they should be allowed to disrupt other students or do you think they should be removed (ie with force)?
Like consent an invitation can be rescinded at any time. They told her to leave and she didn‚Äôt. They could then use reasonable force.
Umm, you certainly do have the right if someone is trespassing on your property. You should evaluate the incident without including your biases because you believe in the cause of the advocates.
Well, the protesters said they would call police and they were invited to - and that didnt happen. So im going to guessing this ends up with a big fat 0. It‚Äôs a nothing burger that you want to white knight about and seem edgy.

Oh sorry, forgot to say bro again so you can try and feel superior about language üòÇ. Sorry bro.
Why did they remain after being asked to leave? 

Let‚Äôs see if you can answer it this time
She clearly says in the video she has already asked her to leave. Once you are asked to leave you are no longer invited and are trespassing if you refuse to leave.
[deleted]
Don‚Äôt let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.¬†
I mean /r/destiny is your most active subreddit lmfao. The only one coping is you. Being anti-Zionist isn't hating Jews lmfao. 

Muslim hating racist conservative ass. 

At least I'm not a Nazi like you.
Like consent an invitation can be rescinded any time.
Of course you can ask them to leave, but you cannot use force against them if they do not pose a threat to your safety or those of others who are present.
Well, the law student was physically touched without their consent prior to the moment that they were requested to vacate the premises. Given that she was lawfully present there even after she was assaulted but before they were asked to leave, that provides no valid legal defence for the action of physically touching the student. The sequence of events is important in determining the intent of the actions of Mme. Fisk, as it shows that her immediate goal was oriented towards getting the student to stop her speech as supposed to having her leave the premises.
You fuckin idiot
Yeah I‚Äôm finding the best way to respond to these people is to ask for proof. It‚Äôs always regurgitated bull shit they saw on tik tok. No critical thinking
See you in discovery, zionists. Edit: He blocked so he could get the last word. Apartheid of my reddit screen?
Lol. Let me know when a single Constitutional scholar agrees that public employees and contractors lose private property rights. 

Until then, I‚Äôll stick with Eugene Volokh‚Äôs opinion.
That's not a required standard. When someone is trespassing, you may use reasonable force to remove them by law.
THANK YOU. 

Disrupting people at art museums by throwing tomato soup at paintings in a misguided attempt to stop drilling for oil is a shit disruption. 

Civil rights era sit-ins that make bystanders think twice about policy is a productive disruption. 

I can‚Äôt believe college students can‚Äôt discern between good and bad protests.
I agree, and I wasn't saying that the tactic of disrupting a law professor's dinner was the most strategic. I think generally the most effective mass protests are the disruptive ones. That was why I originally commented back to OP who was mocking people who say good protests are disruptive.
Oh it was vandy my bad, got my southern schools confused
Please read up on pogroms. Maybe then you‚Äôll understand why it might be traumatic for a bunch of people to show up to a Jewish profs house and ‚Äúprotest‚Äù.

And again: the Dean should be held to a higher standard than protestors everyone in this conversation already agrees acted like fools. This nation is so fucked that it's a controversial opinion that one shouldn't stoop to the low level of one who is condemned-- **especially** when we're talking about people in places of significant authority.
before you think you got someone, finish the article!¬†


>An oft-repeated mantra among some is that Israel is a settler colonialist country and should be forced to give the land back to the Palestinians. I have no idea how it would be determined who is rightly entitled to what land, but I do know that calling for the total elimination of Israel is antisemitic.


I actually made sure to go back and reread the article before posting, in case I'd misremembered, and when I reached your quote I thought I might've been wrong! I hope you're not approaching readings for classes with this laziness!
It's not antisemitic to want the end of israel; it's anti-zionist, or anti-israel. I also want the end of Saudi Arabia as a religious state, does that mean I want the end of Islam? It would be really wild of me to want the end of the race and culture I belong to!¬†


But also


>you people¬†


IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK.......ü§îü§îü§î
Youre an islamophobe
sure thing goy
sure thing goy. I pray for the day the US policy catches up with the public opinion-- it'll be interesting to see if being surrounded by people you've keep kicking works out without a skirt to hide under :) at Berkeley there's probably not a single Jew outside of BCR who is a zionist, and it's all your fault. gd doesn't love murderers!
I know israel historically hates Holocaust survivors, but you could try to make up for it by being nice to their descendants! (Also yes, the most honorable thing we've ever done was supporting Lenin, as a Ukrainian Jew I can only hope my family was involved with the Party)
I also called you illiterate¬†
Why do you keep bringing up that you're a Jew like thats a credential or something? And yeah I do go to school here.
They're drafted, so yeah that's irrelevant. If they willfully signed up to fight then fine they knew the risks but that's not the case. 

Why would you think that's any better than civilians dying?
You should work for fox news.
Wow. If anyone in this video felt like they were in ""danger"" they sure weren't acting like it.
Yes, but I'm just trying to see which portion was antisemitic
They are going up the whole line of command so I'm not sure what your point is supposed to be. If it was the Chancellor you'd say it's the Chancellor not the president so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Ouuuu you really burnt me with that one, you can use the same fingers you typed all that out with to look into statements made by Dean Chem throughout the years also this is a Berkeley law student dinner and as a protest (to an event she was invited to) she acknowledged Ramadan and pushed her message for the UC divest, she didn't hit anyone or even raise her voice what she stated wasn't absurd and yet she was hit
From the outside, the staff has been empowering the student body to be activist. They have tolerated activism that has resulted in bodily harm, and property damage all because they were told not to like something. Nothing delights me more than this type of behavior showing up on their door step. The same for sf and Oakland, I love the uptick in crime as they are getting what they asked for.

Edit: I‚Äôve lived in the Bay Area and the place is only getting worse, I‚Äôm not particularly interested in debating.
As does your reaction to the criticism directed at you
Is ""support of Israel"" code for ""doesn't want Israel eradicated""?
Would you ask the same questions about the holocaust or Rwanda?

It's classic antisemetic behaviour to deny the holocaust in the same way you are doing, both are gross.
Look it up yourself! (This isn‚Äôt to say I‚Äôm not confident in the credibility of the account, but you could use this  opportunity as an exercise to learn how to look up stuff for yourself üòÄ)
Don‚Äôt be manipulative. They didn‚Äôt have a Star Trek transporter such that they could immediately disappear. She agreed to turn off the mic and put it down very quickly, and they left. She cannot disappear within 10 seconds after being asked.
How is she supposed to leave when the assaulting professor [has her arm literally around the students neck?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelCrimes/comments/1c0hqmp/the_uc_berkeley_law_professor_assaults_a/?sort=new) Is that how you ask someone to leave? By assaulting them? By coming up behind them and attacking them? Where before that do you hear anything from the professor?

lmao
Can you imagine if a bar had this policy lol.  They would need to call the police every 10 minutes to remove drunk people.  

If I invited someone into my Home and due to their actions I wanted them out I would definitely help them along the way
You should read the update to the OP. They‚Äôve added the text of the law that explicitly says you‚Äôre wrong.
Bullshit you can absolutely use reasonable force,  it's California law
They were very clearly told to leave prior to this. Terrible analysis.
What if I showed up to your apartment with a katana 
(JOKING DONT GET RUFFLED UP)
In my department, we have dinners at professors' homes during grad student visits. They are treated as (fun) work events, and the catering is expensed. I wouldn't be surprised if this event was too, and it would be entirely appropriate for the Dean to expense a dinner to celebrate a graduating class.¬†¬†


If the professor paid for it himself, then good on him! Also covers his ass in this case, and it would be good karma rewarded for a good deed.
You‚Äôre the far left version of a Trump supporter. All racial hatred, no facts.
You spew ‚Äúzionists‚Äù like it‚Äôs a slur, showing your hand as a bigot
Clowns can‚Äôt stop being clowns. 

By your clown rationale, the government could simply side step the US Constitution simply by hosting events in venues NOT owned by the state. 

UC Berkeley will be writing a check. Guaranteed.
According to California law as cited in the OP, reasonable force can only be used upon determination that the trespasser poses a threat to the home/property or the owner/occupants. If this is not the case, the police are the only party authorized to use force to remove the individual(s).
You‚Äôre not very smart
jfc if u genuinely think that this equates to a pogrom and that chewinsky has nothing to do with funding the genocide beyond simply being jewish, then i have nothing more to say to u
Only applies AFTER the trespasser poses a threat. Otherwise you just wait for the cops. Which is 100% how it should work or else you get people inviting you into their property, withdrawing that invite, and then immediately using force...

Like not sure why you're hoping for a much much world here lol
[This is what you're supporting. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelCrimes/comments/1byvyq8/genocide_or_pedophilia_why_not_both/#lightbox)If I were you, I'd be *ashamed*, embarrassed. But some people just lack the ability to feel shame. There's a word for that.
I disagree that Dean Chem can't speak up about his own experiences of Jewish hate simply because he's a dean when he's been personally targeted for years now.

I'll agree with you that we're fucked.
I've read the whole thing too, and you're the one being lazy. He said it's antisemitic to call for the elimination of Israel. You presented that as him saying it's antisemitic to ""oppose"" Israel.
>It's not antisemitic to want the end of israel

YES IT IS

>I also want the end of Saudi Arabia as a religious state

Literally NOT ONE of you is saying ""Netanyahu needs to go, the settler right needs to be voted out of power"", actually fucking criticism of the government.

You are all saying ""from river to sea"" and other ways of basically saying Israel as a country with people that have self determination rights, should cease existing and at best be absorbed into some larger Palestinian state.

This is why you people are such god damn liars. You aren't even honest changing your literal demands every other sentence when called out on it.

It isn't that fucking hard to say Netanyahu is bad for Israel. Tons of people do it just fine like Schumer and Biden. But that isn't what you want so stop fucking lying.
You want ‚Äúthe end of Israel‚Äù and ‚Äúthe end of Saudi Arabia as a religious state‚Äù. Those seem like pretty different things to me.
By ‚Äúyou people‚Äù we mean Hamas supporters such as yourself. Like when you say ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù but you really mean ‚Äúyou Jews.‚Äù
Really? You don‚Äôt think there are any Zionist Jews at Berkeley? I‚Äôm quite surprised.
This guy is so Jewish he thinks ""goy"" is an insult.
We dont claim you
Self-hating Jew is the most classic Jewish cultural trope of all time. See Karl Marx. We also don‚Äôt actually use ‚Äúgoy‚Äù as an insult like that, that‚Äôs a thing white supremacists claim we do to justify their bizarre race theory victim complex. 

I highly doubt that you are Jewish. You‚Äôre an antisemite either cosplaying as Jewish, or a Jew who hates yourself so much that you‚Äôve consumed so many lies about your own people, that you‚Äôve become a Jewish uncle Ruckus. 

Either way, I pity you.
Oh no looks like I struck a nerve by pointing out who the original antizionists were:

>Dr. Naumann scored the Zionists for their retention of Jewish customs and their unquenchable desire to create a Jewish nation. He declared they were intrinsically traitors to the country in which they lived. On this basis he supported Nazi action against the famous scientist, Albert Einstein, because he is a Zionist.

If youre parroting a literal nazi, maybe it's time for some self reflection, not stupid obfuscation about how ashamed your grandparents are of you
you're right, why would being Jewish be material in a discussion of antisemitism? you guys are so silly-- stay in school!
as I said in the last comment: stay in school, you might learn something!¬†
They can‚Äôt afford me
Yet nobody can tell me why they were on the property
I am going to assume you are asking a sincere question.  

Jews were depicted in Europe as blood thirsty (literally) drinking the blood of Christian children (babies) especially around Passover time.  The fork and knife was reminiscent of that.
On the extended video Prof Fisk says (paraphrasing) the law school is not involved in investment and there is nothing we can do. 

This was a pre graduation celebration dinner. If the protestor wanted to stand on the street with a sign there would not be an issue.  She was inside their home (backyard).  They own the home.  It is a private event.
I agree fully. Thanks for sharing.
Sure, you can seek all the names of the Holocaust.  You know this right?  It is basic history
‚ÄúI‚Äôll make a claim and provide no evidence‚Äù The onus is on you to back up the claim when asked. So I‚Äôll just interpret this as a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to cite tic tok.
So again, why did she remain after being asked to leave?
She could have left any time before, when she was asked to leave.

You are most certainly free to do that, but if there is no threat of physical/bodily harm posed to you you are opening yourself up to a possible criminal charge. That‚Äôs free legal advice for you. You‚Äôre welcome
If you look at the first paragraph under s. 3475, it states that if it appears to a reasonable person that the trespasser poses a threat to the home/property or to the owner/occupants, that the owner/lawful occupants can use reasonable force to make the trespasser leave. In the video, there is nothing to suggest that the trespasser poses a threat to the home/property nor to the owner/occupants. Therefore, this does not allow the owners to use any force to remove them as there is no threat to the safety of the owners or legal occupants. Only the police are legally authorized to use force in the removal of the trespasser.
Crack heads gonna crack
Actually, if you watch the video you‚Äôll see that Catherine Fisk comes down the steps and tries to grab her phone and the mic right before she screams ‚Äúleave‚Äù after which her husband also does so. I‚Äôm sorry that this doesn‚Äôt serve your narrative but facts are facts. It is refreshing to see those 2 professors spend a brief moment to experience a small part of how Palestinians have felt for the last 75 years.
ü•µ
Where does it mention the necessity of physical/bodily harm?
>You‚Äôre not very smart

I guess thats why they never claimed the most effective protest is smart. You can only use the tools you have in your toolbox.
Actually no, this is describing the evaluation of the defendant's subjective belief. I sure hope you didn't go to UCB law school.
*links random post from an ISRAEL CRIMES subreddit and thinks it's a huge gotcha* 

Where's a real source? Where's the original? Where's the context? How do we know this wasn't a doctored image with added text? How do we know it wasn't his own daughter's sock? Who benefits from this image? Critical thinking moment: Do pedophiles usually post on the internet admitting to their crimes?

Did no one teach you any media literacy?
Did I say he can't speak about antisemitism? Or did I say that it's irresponsible to intentionally misuse our shared history of pogroms and genocide because there was a protest aimed against him which used a cartoon that could be misrepresented?
That's called the ""motte"" and ""bailey"" fallacy!
What I said was that he is a zionist. When asked for evidence I linked an article wherein he says that calling for the elimination of the state of Israel is antisemitic. This is direct evidence of his support of zionism-- definitionally the support of a Jewish state in Palestine--, and you're misrepresenting the nature of my claim. He is a zionist, and that claim was the origin of my comment.
Do you think I don't want a replacement state in Palestine lmao? I want a Palestine where Jews and Palestinians and whoever the hell else wants to be there are equal political subjects. I want the same in Saudi Arabia. It's natural to return to the name that is more historically accurate for the country that would succeed the current one in the case of the one that was recently settled by people from outside (you could also, since semantics matter so deeply to you, say I want 'the end of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia'-- insofar as I want a secular and equal state of 'Saudi Arabia' to replace it)
sure thing goy
Im squarely in the fuck these annoying pro-Palestine ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù camp (you can check my comment history), but I think theuncleiroh may be correct based on my very limited outsider experience. 

I‚Äôm not Jewish but did go to a lot of private schools in the Bay Area with a ton of Jewish students. And I actually agree that a decent 50% or even more of the opinion was not very favorable towards Israel (once again based on my very limited outsider exposure). 

The Bay Area is obviously more liberal and  it seemed like support for the Israeli government was seen as a more right wing position even back then (10-20 years ago). My hypothesis is that many of the more liberal Jews I met were not practicing and thus didn‚Äôt have that religious connection to Israel. And most generally didn‚Äôt have much intrinsic connection having no familial ties to the country. Especially since the currently defined state of Israel was only formed in the 1940‚Äôs and most of the ones I met were either Ashkenazi Jews (ie from Europe) or had been in the US for so many generations it didn‚Äôt matter. 

Most of the Jewish kids I met were either in the two-state solution camp or the ‚ÄúI prefer not to think about it‚Äù camp. 

(Edit: just realized based on your username that you‚Äôre probably Jewish too so I‚Äôm open to being corrected on this lol)
It was certainly not a common position when I was there a few years ago, and I have a hard time imagining it has become more popular in the face of changing generational beliefs and growing awareness (& brazenness) of israeli belligerence.
no, I think 'zionist' or 'israeli' is an insult. I think 'goy' is a statement of fact!

>If the defendant‚Äôs beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have actually existed.

Given the violence at recent pro-Palestine protests and the antisemitic blood libel used to rally students, there‚Äôs a fairly good case for the woman to be afraid‚Äîand that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs necessary.
She was throwing out blood libel claims, historically used to incite violence against Jews. After they ran a blood libel poster campaign. I would say that a reasonable person would think that‚Äôs a threat to the owner and any Jewish occupants.
Yeah because the protesters deliberately cut off the first part where they asked her to leave multiple times.

>It is refreshing to see those 2 professors spend a brief moment to experience a small part of how Palestinians have felt for the last 75 years.

I'm sure they're used to it,  people have been invading jews' homes and decrying us for fighting back for over 2000 years
You are (un?)surprisingly confident that this 20 second clip shows the entire event
That‚Äôs exactly what a threat to the property or homeowner means. The spirit of the law is not to protect the feelings of 2 adult crybabies who got their feelings hurt after people pointed out their support for genocide.

Before ""reasonable force"" is allowed, there needs to be a threat. Otherwise you are not allowed to use force. That's why land lords call cops to evict too.
In the end, you're allowed to believe whatever you want.

Good lord man, you are beyond help
Right. Unfortunately, you are too. But I urge you to work those atrophied critical thinking muscles.
I've seen the poster, given that it's publicly available. It's a bad argument to say 'this thing is this thing because this thing is this thing'. This obviously won't be a settled point between us-- you believe him when he says it's in the tradition of blood libel, whereas I've studied this and don't believe that it does (even if it has qualities of such a representation)--, so I'll leave it here. I only continued this long because I didn't appreciate my statement being extended to say things I intentionally didn't say (or explicitly said to the contrary!), but that seems to be over.
israel =/= Jews. We've existed a lot longer, and mostly exist elsewhere. it neither represents us nor has a mandate to, so opposing it, while materially affecting many Jews, is not a prejudice against Jews, any more than, say, an opposition to the Holy Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, or any other so-called seat of Christendom could be considered anti-Christian. Antisemitism is prejudice against Jews, nothing more and nothing less. israel is a theocratic nation-state run almost entirely by Jews, but that doesn't make opposition to it anti-Jewish (I'd argue the opposite: conflating me and any other Jew with no connection to israel *is* antisemitic, as it implies Jews as a whole are responsible for this monstrosity).


I hope you're being honest with the question, as I do understand confusion.
I had a 3.93, what does that say about Berkeley hahaha (you wouldn't know, you don't go)
Yes, it takes some, let's calling it healing to be generous, among both sides to fix a generational problem. Is the answer to keep the wound gushing, especially when it's becoming increasingly (& moreover it's been) apparent that a two-state solution is a one-state solution with even more blood (israel annexing all Palestinian land and disenfranchising more and more Arabs in favor of an increasingly ethnostate arrangement, 'justified' in israeli eyes by increasing anger and radicalism by those who they are dispossessing).


The fact that it's hard is a sign that it should've been done from the start, not a sign that we should shrug and keep supporting the belligerent because the situation we've empowered has got so toxic. The first step to doing so is to put all our power in that direction; israel will either start acting like a reasonable actor (knowing they are actually subject to reprisal so long as the USA defends Tel Aviv more stringently than it would San Francisco), or will face consequences for their continued malfeasance, and thus face a necessary end or at least demonstrate to the world their essential madness (these both being much worse outcomes, as they'd result in mass death of Jews and Muslims).


The simple truth is that unconditional support in the face of atrocity only empowers irrational actors, and that's bad for the world. While America has always been far too supportive of israel for my tastes, it wasn't always unconditional like this-- even Reagan was willing to tell them no, and it's only got worse since israel has gone rogue in the international community with our support.
yes I interacted with each individual Jew at chabad/temple/haas/communist clubs and asked each their opinion on Levantine affairs, and in no way could be interpreted as meaning I used inductive reason

UC opens civil rights investigation over law professor who assaulted their Muslim guest,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ckb879/uc_opens_civil_rights_investigation_over_law/,2024-05-04 14:38:53,"The investigation by the university‚Äôs Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination stems from an April 9 incident at the home of professor Catherine Fisk and her husband, Erwin Chemerinsky who is dean of the university‚Äôs law school.

An invitee of the dinner party, a female muslim  graduating law student, was subjected to physical assault, harassment, and discrimination by Fisk and Chemerinsky, when she attempted to deliver a peaceful speech about Ramadan and the genocide occurring in Palestine. Fisk put her arms around the student, pulling at her hijab and scarf, and forcibly wrestled a microphone and phone away from the student, pulling the student with her.

> An invitee of the dinner party, a female muslim graduating law student, was subjected to physical assault, harassment, and discrimination by Fisk and Chemerinsky, when she attempted to deliver a peaceful speech about Ramadan and the genocide occurring in Palestine.

Oh c'mon, we all know that's bullshit. She was going to take advantage of the space she found herself in to criticize Dean Chemerensky. You have to be on some serious shrooms to think you saw Fisk physically assaulting or harassing her. 

>Fisk put her arms around the student, pulling at her hijab and scarf, and forcibly wrestled a microphone and phone away from the student, pulling the student with her.

Where in the video is Fisk pulling at her hijab and scarf? Please tell me exactly where. It simply never happened. Fisk and Chemerensky asked her to leave and refused to do so. If taking the microphone would have deplatformed her, and caused her to leave (like she was being asked to do), then Fisk was well within her right to try taking it away.

You have to be living in la-la land if you think just the fact that Dean Chemerensky decided to invite his law school students to a dinner, forced him to completely forgo his basic right to decide who can and cannot be on his own property.
The Dean and the professor should go to the police and charge that entitled, narcissistic, it‚Äôs all about me and my agenda student with trespassing & harassment. It is clear that she was asked many times to leave and refused. This whole affair is truly sickening.¬†
She was no longer a guest bc she was asked to leave.  Assault is an exaggeration.
Wow I bet if a Muslim teacher did the same to a Jewish female student, IDF would have crept out of the bushes and shot her... such Hippocrates... unbelievable!!!!
> Where in the video is Fisk pulling at her hijab and scarf? Please tell me exactly where.

At 0:25 Fisk wraps her around the student and grabs her by her scarf and hijab. At 0:55 Fisk forcibly grabs the students mic and hand and frags the student up the stairs by force

> You have to be living in la-la land if you think just the fact that Dean Chemerensky decided to invite his law school students to a dinner, forced him to completely forgo his basic right to decide who can and cannot be on his own property.

To be correct, they were hosting an official dinner for graduating law students sponsored by UC Berkeley. By doing so, Fisk and Chemerensky's property is no longer private property, and is an extension of UC property which the woman and other guests are enrolled students in UC Berkeley
https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/assault
>At 0:25 Fisk wraps her around the student and grabs her by her scarf and hijab.

Are you referring to the video found in the article you linked? Because that literally never happens. Fisk had her land laying on the student's shoulder, but never did she make the attempt to grab ahold of her scarf and hijab.

>At 0:55 Fisk forcibly grabs the students mic and hand and frags the student up the stairs by force

I already explained why I thought Fisk was well within her right to take that course of action.

>To be correct, they were hosting an official dinner for graduating law students sponsored by UC Berkeley.

I'd really like to take a look at this claim. What exactly made the dinner officially sponsored by UC Berkeley? I'm genuinely curious as to what you believe. Is it simply the fact that Chemerensky holds the position of Dean and decided to have a dinner related to students' academic achievements? Did the school advertise the event on a public page? Or is it because the expenses of the dinner were directly covered by UC (which I'm not sure if they were)?  Like I said, I'm genuinely curious.

>Fisk and Chemerensky's property is no longer private property, and is an extension of UC property which the woman and other guests are enrolled students in UC Berkeley

Quite the bold claim you're making here. Do you mind offering any cases where this logic was applied on private property in a similar manner.

I feel like you're still ignoring the fact that Chemerensky, even to an extent in a public setting, has the right to intervene and stop the disruption of an event he's attempting to hold.
I don‚Äôt think you read the link. 

There was no physical harm, so you‚Äôd have to prove Fisk intended harm (she didn‚Äôt). 

The student would also have to prove she felt harm was intended, but she didn‚Äôt. Homegirl just stood there rambling on like an ass. If she felt threatened, she‚Äôd have moved out of the way of harm. 

You‚Äôd never be able to prove there was an assault, bc there wasn‚Äôt one. It was just an altercation.
Here, let me read it for you

""No physical injury is required, but the actor must have intended to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the victim and the victim must have thereby been put in immediate apprehension of such a contact.""

‚ÄúHarmful or offensive‚Äù in the context of assault, is an objective standard referring to touching that is likely to or capable of causing harm or offending a reasonable person by violating prevailing social standards of acceptable touching. (It's violating social standards to put your hands on someone else, touch a Muslim woman's scarf or especially her hijab, and definitely violating norms by dragging the student up the stairs)

However, an otherwise inoffensive contact may be deemed offensive if the tortfeasor knew the victim was unusually averse to such a contact. (Fisk definitely knew such touching is inappropriate)

Reasonable apprehension‚Äù in the context of assault, refers to the victim‚Äôs reasonable belief that the act will lead to imminent harmful or offensive contact.
The victim does not need to prove fear, only that they were aware that such a contact might occur.
Yeah, that‚Äôs a stretch"
