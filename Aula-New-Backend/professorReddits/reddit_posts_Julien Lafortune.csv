Econ 130: Using economics for public policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wh6yj6/econ_130_using_economics_for_public_policy/,2022-08-05 14:31:09,"Hi guys! Has anyone taken this class before with Julien Lafortune? How’s the Professor and the class in general? Is it difficult and is the material particularly math or coding heavy (and if so, can you for the most part pick up the skills in the class)? Also, did he record his lectures and does he take attendance? I’m worried I might have to miss a couple classes due to a conflicts and whether that might affect my ability to get a good grade.","It's a great class; it is qualitative and not a lot of math. You do use Stata, but the coding isn't hard. 

When I took it, lectures were recorded. I think it's a pretty informative, enjoyable class
Is the Econ 1 requirement enforced?"
