How is professor Mark Danner?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y46p2s/how_is_professor_mark_danner/,2022-10-14 15:06:26,"I might be taking a course taught by Mark Danner next semester, but I can't find any info on him on Rate my professor. What is he like? What about his courses? His [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Danner) certainly makes him sound pretty cool.","I loved his class for Beckett last semester, and the class wasn‚Äôt difficult. We had a creative paper and then an analytic paper. Didn‚Äôt take attendance either.
Cool dude, not a great professor, I‚Äôd stay away
He's had some of the most interesting courses in the English department by reading list / subject matter that I've seen. I've heard good things from those who've taken his classes.
Yeah I've heard from other students that he's pretty good. I've decided to sign up for him üëç
Gotcha. Any reason in particular to stay away?
Definitely some interesting things I'm seeing in his Film Noir course posting. 

How difficult are his classes, from what you've heard?
I can't speak to that, unfortunately."
"Cal professor Mark Danner published ""Spiral: Trapped In the Forever War."" Danner writes Obama has not only neglected many of his campaign promises, but along with Bush, deserves blame for ISIS's rise and spread. He opposes Obama's aggressive use of drones and refusal to close Guantanamo Bay prison.",http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Spiral-Trapped-in-the-Forever-War-by-Mark-7973678.php,2016-06-12 19:34:18,,
