Stat 134 Adjunct Class,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15xqqwf/stat_134_adjunct_class/,2023-08-21 18:24:13,"Does anyone know if Mike Leong is teaching the adjunct class this semester? And if he is, how I can sign up for his class? I've heard Adam Lucas' class is pretty bad so I want all the help I can get this semester.",It’s very likely but you will find out day 1 of class.
Stat 198 with Leong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6jh3vj/stat_198_with_leong/,2017-06-25 15:11:32,"I'll be taking Stat 134 in the fall and am wondering if any of you would recommend taking the adjunct course -- Stat 198 -- with it. The instructor is listed as Leong on the SLC website, who I'm assuming is Mike Leong. Thanks for any advice!","I had 134 with Leong and he was quite good at teaching it.  I sat in on Pitman's course with a friend and it was honestly worse, which was disappointing since Leong mostly follows his book.

Anyway, don't know about the 198 course but Leong is pretty good.
Take it. It's a lot of extra work and sometimes you'll regret it-but it will help you. People that take 198 tend to do MUCH better in the class. Your grade will be much better if you take it vs if you don't. Keep in mind its a lot of extra work though.
Thanks for the advice. Can you explain exactly how adjunct courses work? Is there extra homework, are there quizzes, etc.? Is it all mandatory? What was most helpful about it for you when you took it?
Hey did you end up taking the adjunct? Is there homework and quizzes? How important would you say taking the adjunct is? I have a time conflict with the adjunct and wanted to know if i should consider changing my schedule to make space for the adjunct.
I didn’t end up taking it so unfortunately can’t say. Good luck though
how well did you end up doing without the adjunct? Would you say that the adjunct is vital towards doing okay in the class?
i did fine without it, don't stress it too much"
Will Leong give out no pass for Stat198?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zjqlrw/will_leong_give_out_no_pass_for_stat198/,2022-12-11 22:58:43,"The case for me is that I am now in Leong's adjunct class for Stat 134, and I have pnp Stat 134 now. For Stat 198, I successfully corrected all the quizzes and finished the assignment before midterm 1, but nothing really completed after it. I have also done the final assignment. I was a bit worried about no passing because I had missed many quizzes after midterm 1, but, as I already pnp Stat 134 and I am in no need to take the final exam, I actually don't want to spend extra time for Stat 198. For anyone who has taken Stat198 before, will Mike give out any no pass, or am I in a situation of no pass? Very much appreciate for any answer!",They do give out NPs if you don’t do the minimum quizzes or corrections. I’d say just spend a couple of hours doing it. You’ll thank yourself later when you don’t get an NP in a fucking 1 unit adjunct
