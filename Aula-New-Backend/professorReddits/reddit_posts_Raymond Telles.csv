Art and Chicano classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u7hd1z/art_and_chicano_classes/,2022-04-19 15:29:54,"Hi has anyone taken the following classes or had the following professors:

&#x200B;

Chicano 130 - Jesus Barraza: Mexican and Chicano art history

Chicano 135b - Raymond Telles: Contemporary Latino film/Latino Narrative Film Since 1990

Art 8 - Allan Desouza: Intro to visual thinking

Art 119: Global perspectives in contemporary art

&#x200B;

If so, could you pls comment on how interesting the courses were and about how much workload they had as well as the structure of the class. Thank you!!","[removed]
Art 8 is pretty easy. Would like to note that it is an ""introduction to visual thinking"" and not an introduction on how to do art.
Jesusâ€™ class was awesome! And heâ€™s a super chill prof. :)
Hi I was wondering how much the workload was for art 119? I wanted to take it with cs 70
?
[removed]
is it mostly analyzing art? or do you not make art at all throughout?
Tell me more! Iâ€™m gonna take his class this fall
I didnâ€™t end up taking it sorry :(
Was Chicano 135b heavy workload or hard? I am taking chem 3a so want to know if it will be too much
There are 3 projects throughout the course in which you will work on to create art pieces, but it's not a traditional art class where they show you how to draw, paint, etc.

Okay thanks! Not sure but people who are taking it say itâ€™s bad"
"new grads of fall 2022 or spring 2022, how are you fairing in the job market with the tech layoffs",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10aby6o/new_grads_of_fall_2022_or_spring_2022_how_are_you/,2023-01-12 13:53:56,@ cs/data science people,"Handshakes a desert rn, lowkey strugglin
ghosted by nearly everything I applied to, gave up and took a return offer
This happened 20 years ago. Many of us (myself included) said, ""fuck this shit"" and fucked off to grad school.
Got a Google offer last year, got the offer rescinded in â€˜23. 4 months and 100+ rejections and ghosts later, finally secured a pretty nice job at a startup, with much less pay but still a job that pays enough to survive in the bay
Not great, I'll tell you that.
â€˜23 grads are way more screwed than â€˜22 grads. At least so far layoffs have only hit a pretty small fraction of people. Fall â€˜21 (when most of the â€˜22 folks were applying) was a red-hot hiring season, and to be blunt a bunch of people got jobs they probably wouldnâ€™t have gotten in a normal year. 

â€˜23 grads are fucked all around.
itâ€™s tough out here
I got a job in October after 280 applications.

It goes to show how shitty our alumni is 

Not even getting a degree from berkeley can help you land a decent job
Back to Cal?
Iâ€™m way too young to remember the dot com crash, but from what my coworkers say this one doesnâ€™t seem nearly as bad so far.
Donâ€™t forget to fuck out of it when the market improves. Some of us stayed too damn long..
I would say the worst period to find a job for software people would have been the dot.com implosion circa 2002 to mid-2003.  Also up there - the bank bailout period in 2009; and a small period right when Covid hit in the last 3 quarters of 2020.  The recession that started in late 1990 thru early 1991 was also bad, as stuff was hard to find thru 1992.  I myself was a victim during a couple of those periods mentioned.
Happened to my friend with a very cut of the mill e-commerce. Heâ€™s living the high life now 5 years later. You got this :)
ok raymond

Berkeley unfortunately did not extend a return offer. It may be because i never applied for grad school, but really who's to say
What return offer are you talking about then?
oh I didn't realize you weren't joking, sorry. I had previously interned at a place I really liked and they gave me a great fulltime offer at the end of the summer since I had done well and they wanted me to come back. I more or less planned to take it from the get go, but I applied to a bunch of other places just to hopefully scoop some competing offers to put me in a better negotiating position. Most of my friends are in a similar spot tooâ€”they had previous internships and they're just going back their fulltime since the whole market has been pretty rough lately."
