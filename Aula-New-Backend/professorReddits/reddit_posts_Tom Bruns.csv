What is this ? All of a sudden I’m seeing so many funky mushrooms on north side….. does anyone know what this has to do with seasonal changes and what type of mushrooms they are ?,https://i.redd.it/dsf9jflvxbb81.jpg,2022-01-12 14:03:33,,"[Professor Tom Bruns](https://plantandmicrobiology.berkeley.edu/users/tom-bruns) in the Plant Microbial Bio Department is the guy you oughtta talk to. He teaches the California Mushrooms course.
It's the season for mushrooms - get out into forest-lands and you'll see a huge variety of mushrooms right now.
Some stoner’s piss probably.
Try r/mushrooms to see if they can identify it.
Lol, I 100% believe you live in Berkeley."
