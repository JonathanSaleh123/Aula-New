My class schedule opinions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15rh1m5/my_class_schedule_opinions/,2023-08-14 20:36:19,"Hi,

I'm a new transfer student for the upcoming fall term. I'm considering majoring in data science. Is my current schedule suitable for the semester? Also, I've enrolled in EPS C20 and EPS 7 just to meet my minimum credits.

Instead of wasting credits on the EPS classes, you should figure out what your domain emphasis will be and take a class or two from there instead.
However EPS C20 is a fantastic option for physical sciences breadth if OP doesn’t have that covered already
If the person is a transfer student, it’s almost certain all of his or her breadths are covered.
Oh that’s true I completely blanked on that oops"
Stat 20 professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wkikwq/stat_20_professor/,2022-08-09 16:56:02,"Can anyone recommend a professor for Stat20 for this fall? For fall there is Iain Carmichael, Shobhana Murali Stoyanov, Jeremy Sanchez, and Andrew Bray (waitlist tho).

I'm currently enrolled for Stoyanov but I saw some comments from ratemyprofessor and trying to get some opinions from others. I'm an intended econ major so I hope to meet the gpa requirement to declare this semester :,)","Jeremy Sanchez was my GSI last semester and Andrew Bray was my prof last semester. Both of them are really nice and helpful, I would say Jeremy is really new so I’m not sure how he would teach in a big lecture class but if u attend his office hours and ask questions you should be fine with him!
Andrew Bay all the way!
i had stoyanov (asynch) and her exams were in-person and we were allowed 4 pg cheat sheets. her coursework is decently doable but her lecturing is not the best. class is curved as well so you should be fine if u can score above avg and take the time to review concepts wo being lecture dependent.
Andrew Bray for sure! If this isn't too late, I had him for Stat 20 and had an absolutely amazing time in his class."
