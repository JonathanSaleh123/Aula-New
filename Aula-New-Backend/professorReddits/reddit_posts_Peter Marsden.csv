Chem 3b Peter Marsden Textbook and Syllabus,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13gx22q/chem_3b_peter_marsden_textbook_and_syllabus/,2023-05-13 17:09:48,I'm taking chem 3b next semester with Marsden and want to get a head start over the summer. Does anyone know which textbook he uses and the most recent syllabus? Thanks!!!!!,pump
Is Peter Marsden teaching chem 1A in the spring,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hqxvne/is_peter_marsden_teaching_chem_1a_in_the_spring/,2020-07-14 01:38:30,I am so sorry I tried so hard googling and idk how to know. I was advised he was a great chem professor and would like to try and take it with him if possible. Thank you very much!,"Honestly, no one knows. I thought he would teach in the spring of this year, but it was a different professor. But, if you don't want to take the course in the fall, I honestly think it's ok to take it in spring in which it might be slightly easier.
I think heâ€™s trying to teach more upper div classes and o chem so Iâ€™m not even sure if he will ever teach 1A again. Spring is generally easier (or has a better curve), regardless of professor, if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re looking for.

Pete is fabulous and definitely the best lecturer in the department. That said, he routinely teaches 1a, 3a, 3b, and 12b, so it's anyone's guess what he's going to teach in a given semester.
Why would spring have a better curve? Is it cuz the tests are harder or something? This feels like a dumb question lol sorry, just curious. TYSM! :)
oh my gosh thank you SO much!! Is this a document you made? I really appreciate your help!
FWIW, thatâ€™s probably not an official spreadsheet since there are spelling errors in them.  Nah it wasnâ€™t me, probably someone aligned with the Chem department though."
is peter marsden teaching chem3B over summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ehs08u/is_peter_marsden_teaching_chem3b_over_summer/,2019-12-30 12:56:51,Any advice on taking chem 3B over summer?,"doubt it seeing as he just taught it this sem.
He may be teaching more upper division courses seeing as he is teaching upper divs next semester (spring) for the first time

True! I took 3A and felt veerrry rushed over the summer, but felt enjoyed 3B more when I took it this past fall semester!"
"rate my schedule, advice/insights",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/192wjen/rate_my_schedule_adviceinsights/,2024-01-09 17:58:04,"hi! i am a freshman (2027) pre-med taking these classes and would like to know if this schedule is feasible, if you have any advice for the courses, or if you have reviews on the professors. please let me know!

* CHEM 3A - Peter Marsden
* Theater 25AC - Angela Marino
* BIO 1B -  John P Huelsenbeck, Michal Ilana Shuldman, Benjamin Wong Blonder, Benjamin K Blackman
* R1A
* Decal","This is a reasonable schedule in my opinion! Marsden has optional HW (you would still want to do it because the HW mirrors the exam) but if you don't feel like doing it you'd always have the flexibility!

BIO 1B is not set up like a weeder class compared to BIO 1A, but it is still a difficult class because of the memorization. The labs are fully done in-lab, so there's no lab report or anything like that due after class.

I haven't taken the rest but this seems very reasonable
Marsden is the best professorv
OMG! THR 25AC is going to be an absolute blast! I had a different professor for that class, but I had Angela for THR 119 and she is the absolute best! Sheâ€™s really understanding about mental health, time conflicts, etc and just wants to encourage discussion :) Of course THR 25AC tends to be a bit bigger than the upper divs, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll be the same in terms of vibes :) Hope you have a great time with her!
hi! no advice but i wanted to say im also taking similar classes w bio 1b:) also pre med! we got this fr
Marsden is amazing! Have fun
The only note is that I believe the BIO 1B and CHEM 3A finals are usually back to back on the same day, but if youâ€™re alright with that, then it looks good!
thank you so much!
what were your thoughts with THTR 119?
yes yes!!!
My class experience was a bit interesting for THR 119. Because of the events in October, our class discussions turned away from actual reading material. A lot of my friends in the class disliked it, but I previously felt like she made a safe space in the class and it was very nice to be able to talk about whatever. The only bad thing is she randomly drops assignments on you. Our final felt like it came out of nowhere. However, I had a lot of fun in the class :)"
Matthew Jurow Chem 3AL,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gvjcre/matthew_jurow_chem_3al/,2020-06-02 17:20:19,hello! so i was under the impression that peter marsden would be teaching 3AL over the summer but i think they changed professors to Matthew Jurow. Does anybody have any experience with this professor? Any tips?,"I just had him this past spring sem and his lectures are very dry but most of all the concepts youâ€™ll need for labs are covered in lecture. He leaves most of the grading and stuff up to the GSIs.
Yeah, it looks like they did. Would like to know as well.
He also reuses a lot of problems from previous exams on his final. Some word for word. 
His lectures are conceptual but dull in presentation. He didn't require attendance so watching online at a faster speed is better. I would say if you want the A, ask your GSI on how they want stuff done because most of your grade is dependent on them. Some are lenient and others are not.
I had him for both 3AL and 3BL. I was able to get an A both semesters. Lectures are a bit boring, but he always gets straight to the point. He tells you exactly what you need to know. Most of the grading is determined by your GSI. Just make sure your notebooks are detailed with observations and collaborate with others on the pre/post labs and you should be good to go. Jurow is an awesome guy and really cares about his students, so don't be afraid to reach out to him!
Same, just saw the email he sent out"
Chemistry Course Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hqxd9k/chemistry_course_advice/,2020-07-14 00:52:53,"I am trying to take chem 32 in the fall, but need approval from the professor to enroll. I haven't heard back after filling out the google form and no email response yet either. My enrollment is Thursday agh. If I can't take chem 32, should i just screw it and take chem1a OR wait till spring semester? 

Someone said Peter Marsden usually teaches chem 1A in the spring but idk how to check if he will be. Teresa Head-Gordon is teaching Fall, and seems like a lot of ppl don't like her and think she's hard? Aghhh idk what to do. Any advice is very much appreciated. Context: dumb lost incoming freshman lol.","[deleted]
Thanks so much for your response! Ya, I haven't taken AP chem lmao, just honors chem sophomore year. I was able to get an A both semesters but struggled still. Would you advise taking chem1a w Head-gordon? I feel very insecure in my chem abilities agh!! That sounds intense!
I'm in the same situation as you, last time I took chem was honors sophomore year. I've been self studying with khan academy and the openstax chem textbook to try and understand as much as possible before 1a. Good luck"
Tips and/or advice for this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/e7iqw3s9ekwa1.jpg,2023-04-27 17:54:31,Tips on how to succeed while taking bio 1a/1al and chem 3b/3bl simultaneously?,"Looks like stairway with a roof
sleep early
did this combo and wanted to cry every single day donâ€™t get behind and try to stay on top of lectures
how was thtr 141??
I have taken all of those classes (at different semesters). TH 60 is an easy A as long as you have good attendance. If you have no other classes, you should be able find with both Chem and Bio. If you are not attending your 8 AMs live, make sure you schedule time to actually watch your lectures. Do not fall behind, especially in Bio 1A.
Oh no :/ are As possible in both?
itâ€™s definitely doable but you just have to manage your time efficiently for both classes, i had a hard time bc I was juggling other commitments and couldnâ€™t dedicate a lot of time"
How bad is this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/u59pqr8rreaa1.jpg,2023-01-05 22:28:04,,"better pack a lunch for tues/thurs
Thatâ€™s a huge L.

At least I only have classes back to back for 7 hours straight on one day of the week.

Probably better than having 2 long days of classes
Fellow BioE here, we have it horrible this semester :')
You gotta do some calorie loading before that huge block on Tuesday and Thursday. I guess that's what Monday's for.
A ziplock bag of trial mix from Trader Joeâ€™s for Tues/Thurs. Convenient, tasty, nutritious, calorie dense, and quick snack. Best of luck ðŸ¤ž
This is bad advice; however if you think you can still survive without going to discussions, I would skip some of them if they are not mandatory
â€¦ there goes your social life. Extra curricularsâ€¦ And sleepâ€¦ who needs it? Good luck though
Weâ€™re in Chem 3A & 3AL together, do you wanna start an early study group!?
![gif](giphy|gd09Y2Ptu7gsiPVUrv|downsized)
You caaan dooo ittt!!!
I do all of my classes back-to-back-to-back on Tues/Thurs because I have a full time job and that's the least disruptive to my schedule. Honestly I dig it. I'd way rather have to hustle and focus and only be on campus two days a week.
I took first semester organic w/ lab, first semester calc based physics, first semester multi, and an easy elective a semester. It was hard, but I got all A's, I had a girlfriend, and I was in ok shape. The one thing is it was at community college, so maybe without the girlfriend and/or dropping exercise you could do it?
You are going to be so sore after every Tuesday and Thursday.
agree with everyone that tues/thu looks really hardâ€” just want to add that educ 182ac was an amazing class and even though itâ€™s an 8am, you should absolutely show up! i learned so much in that class and lisa is a super engaging professor :)
You might wanna drop out after a couple of months of this torture. Best of luck, and remember to eat some protein bars and fruit during those long days
Ngl, id simply kms
I actually had a pretty similar schedule last semester. Youre going to be exhasuted on tuesday and thursday! I found myself not doing studying/hw on those long days but doing a lot on the shorter days, so if thats something youre fine doing then its managebale. Ive had a pretty heavy load every semseter and it definitely takes a toll on me and usually cased some burn out in the middle of the semester.  math 53 isnt rough but physics might take a bit of time. i just finished the physics 5 series and it definitely took the most time in my schedule each semester.
Take 170 with it
Drop 3al for me. Pretty please?
[deleted]
it fine
Seems like a pretty hefty load
that 3A lecture is gonna go hard trust
Kevin is a good gsi, that class will be fine. Everything else, youâ€™re royally fucked
Well itâ€™s not good
horrific
i think we might have the same math class and section lol. kudos to you if you can manage this schedule and i wish you the best of luck!
Yeah ðŸ˜…
So true ðŸ˜‚. Do you have a similar schedule?
Yeah, I was already thinking about skipping math discussions (besides when there is quizzes). I think I do better self-teaching myself math anyways
Iâ€™m down. Iâ€™ll PM you my instagram!
Thanks :)
And I do pack a lunch lol!
Thatâ€™s kind of what I had in mind too! But I originally was on chem lab waitlist for Wednesday, and planned to go home on Friday evening and come back mondays
Also, Ochem is by faaar the most work. For me it was over 50% of time spent studying, and the stuff you learn first semester is so important for second.
This is nice to know. Iâ€™ve been studying Ochem and multivariable on khan academy and other Berkeley professorâ€™s notes. I also took algebra-based physics in high school, so hopefully it will help with 7A. Thanks for sharing!
Educ 182 seems like such an interesting class! Do you remember what the workload was like?
Thatâ€™s what I plan on doing. Grind hw on Monday and Wednesday , and just really pay attention to lectures/ lab on the other days. Do you think math 53 discussion section was helpful?
Iâ€™m still staying open to premed, but leaning towards comp bio / biotech industry. I guess Iâ€™ll have a better idea after seeing how I do in Ochem haha
Fellow bioE junior here who had this schedule, you will die
yeah agree with the other commenter â€” workload really wasnâ€™t too bad, most of the work is reading and a few papers, which are generally pretty straightforward if you keep up. and my discussions tended to be more interactive/activity-based but that depends on the gsi you get
It depends on how your prof outlines discussions. My prof had discussion twice a week with a quiz on the second day each week. If you have a good gsi then the discussions should compliment the course material nicely. I took 54 concurrently and found 54 discussion a waste of time but skipping 53 seemed to lower my understanding so it's dependent on the gsi tbh. Good luck! Discussions are what you make of it
That schedule's rough with ochem in it. Good luck, though! You got this!
Any advice? ðŸ˜„
Pray pray and then pray again. In all seriousness, I would mostly study for Chem 3A by doing every problem set once throughout the week and once before an exam as itâ€™s the only class where actually studying will nearly guarantee you an A (though I had Professor Robak). Math 53 and physics 7A are all up to what type of question you get on the test/if youâ€™re confident with the concept.
Did you find math 53 discussions helpful?
They were useless for me. Book helped a lot
second half of math 53 was A LOT harder so if youâ€™re the same as me then you might be able to settle a lil bit into your schedule for the first few weeks without yet having to worry about math 53 yet"
