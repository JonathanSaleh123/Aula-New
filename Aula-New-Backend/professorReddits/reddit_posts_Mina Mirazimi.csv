Econ 100B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ce86zh/econ_100b/,2024-04-26 23:55:37,Does anyone know how Econ100b with Mina Mirazimi is? ,"Sheâ€™s a new professor from Haas.
Do you know how her class is and how she teaches?
She taught Micro this semester and her GSI carried the class ðŸ¤£ but her exams are okay average is about 80% , offered homework that are worth 100 points each. Sheâ€™s a nice person but not an effective instructor. Iâ€™m not sure how this class will go but she said it should be easier.
Thanks for the information!
taking 100b with Mirazimi too in the fall! Are her lectures mandatory, or do you suggest moreso going to the discussions and self studying?"
