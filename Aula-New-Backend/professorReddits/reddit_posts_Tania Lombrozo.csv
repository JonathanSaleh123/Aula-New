"Berkeley professor Psychology professor Tania Lombrozo reacts to a remark Sen. Marco Rubio made in last Tuesday's Republican presidential debate. He had said, ""Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.""",http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/11/16/456185367/carrying-a-welding-torch-for-philosophy,2015-11-19 08:33:07,,"*fewer philosophers, Mr Rubio. 
Unsurprising, republican politicians love anti-intellectualism to appeal to the masses despite many of them being wealthy and highly educated.
Rubio is right.  

I love how people are analyzing the semantic minutiae of Rubio's statement rather than the actual point, which is mostly true: 
being unable to use your degree to get a job functionally renders said degree useless except for esoteric reasons that don't really put food on the table.  

There's really no functional point to millions of people getting a college degree if they can't get a job.
Students majoring in English, psychology, sociology, ethnic studies, gender and women studies, and LGBT studies will disagree vehemently.
There's a ""point"" to studying the major, it's just more intrinsic than extrinsic. Not everybody chooses to study something just because they want a high paying job. 
I know they will, which is why it's important that Rubio's (legit) viewpoint not be drowned out by mindless accusations of Koch Q. HitlerBushery
Yeah, people love to _say_ this.  Then, after a few years of menial retail work that barely makes ends meet, and swimming in debt, they look for people to blame for their shitty decisions.  Republicans, the 1%, ""the system""...sound familiar?  

You can downvote me all you want, but it's true, Rubio is 100% right. 
You're really missing the point. Education is also about self-fulfillment and just simply learning. It's not all about money. Success and content of living is different for every person. 
You are really missing the point.  

Unless you're suggesting that all this bitching about student loans is just made up?  And all those people in debt or underemployed are actually super fulfilled with their lives because they ""simply learned"" and that brings enjoyment enough?  

That's literally what you're suggesting.  _Either_ people are actually ""successful and content"" with their lives despite being in mountains of debt from ill-advised learning choices (because money doesn't matter to them, right?), _or_ there is a student loan crisis in this country.  Pick one.  
That's not what I'm suggesting. If you're in debt and underemployed, that's your fault for choosing to go to university when you knew you couldn't afford it. If you have the money for college saved up, or work a day job I absolutely say go ahead and choose a liberal arts major if you find the subject interesting. There are many jobs you can still have after college that don't correlate with your degree at all that you can have decent income with. Not to mention starting something of your own and working for yourself with what you learned in school.

Alright, so you _do_ agree with Rubio, you just think you don't. 
Are you seriously using _congress_ as an example of why the humanities are great? 
No, I don't agree with the fact that ""being unable to use your degree to get a job functionally renders said degree useless except for esoteric reasons that don't really put food on the table."" because it assumes a degree is useless due to not many job openings in that area. Majoring in something is an investment of knowledge, which is priceless. People are in debt after college because they chose to attend a school they couldn't afford, not their choice of major.

 Just because your major by itself can't land a popular high paying job doesn't mean you can't make money. My uncle majored in history at a liberal arts college and enjoyed every four years of it and is knowledgeable about how our culture and societies came to be as a result. He also works at an oil rig and makes $200,000 a year.
> Majoring in something is an investment of knowledge, which is priceless. 

Tell that to every indebted grad as they march toward bankruptcy, I'm sure it will warm their hearts. 
Did you even read my next sentence? It's their own fault those people decided to go to an expensive university they knew they couldn't afford instead of going to community college. Has nothing to do with their major. 
Postgrad income has _nothing_ to do with their major?  Really?  Zero? 
Um, yeah. 
This lack of understanding on your part about the value of different majors explains this entire thread. 

I suggest you, um, educate yourself:

oh and be sure to downvote, surely that will reduce the cachet of the facts presented. 
I feel pretty bad for you, so have some gold. 
Invested like a philosopher.
