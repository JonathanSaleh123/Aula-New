"Alison Gopnik, Cal psychology professor: 4-Year-Olds Don't Act Like Trump. ""In my lab we have found 4-year-olds recognize that their own past beliefs might have been wrong. Trump contradicts himself without hesitation and doesn't seem to recognize any conflict between his past and present beliefs.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/opinion/sunday/4-year-olds-children-trump-gopnik.html,2017-05-21 16:15:47,,"I mean, I hate Trump as much as the next person, but toddlers seem to be a bit less deceptive/scheming than adults in general (right?). Not to say that Trump is intentionally an idiot, it could certainly be unintentional. 
Off topic, but I love the fact that exactly a quarter of this comment section is trolling. 
I keep saying this when people refer to him as a toddler.  I raised two toddlers that weren't nearly as illogical as he is.  The tantrums look familiar, but he's much less aware of reality that any 3 year old I've ever met.  
Jesus christ that's such a reach lol
This. Drumpf is living in a post-fact world. Every time his statements turn out to be fake news, he refuses to retract; he just sits on Steve Bannon's knee pouting and consoling himself with two scoops of cheeto-flavored ice cream. Even a child makes a better effort at being honest, remorseful, and humble when they make a mistake.
how many presidents and billionaires have you raised?
Okay lol most of your comments are pretty stale by now but this one was pretty fucking funny"
