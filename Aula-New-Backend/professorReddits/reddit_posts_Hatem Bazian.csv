CS Majors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13rpl2v/cs_majors/,2023-05-25 11:38:24,"What have been the best breath classes you've took. What are the worst? For CS majors that know that they wanna do CS and don't wanna discover anything else, are they actually tedious?","Lamaze classes are great as a breath class.

In all seriousness,  there are tons of good breadths out there at Berkeley.  You should be more open minded about this.  Example classes:

Astro C10 Intro to Astronomy (you actually already have a built in Physical Sciences breadth class in CS 61C do this would possibly be a waste for you)

Psych C61 Brain Mind and Behavior

MCB C62 Drugs and the Brain 

HIST 190 Soccer a Global History

PUBPOL C103 Wealth and Poverty (but Prof Reich is retiring)
ASAMST 128 AC Muslim in America. Hatem Bazian most lenient grader ever
>	What have been the best breath classes you‚Äôve took

CS majors don‚Äôt brush their teeth so all of their breath classes are terrible. The worst one imo is probably Halitosis 61B.


/j
Not necessarily uninterested in exploring other things, but u definitely have a preference for STEM classes. That being said, Philos 3 was one of the most fun classes I've taken at Berkeley.
History 171C (history of the USSR) was dummy easy.  No hw, just 2 midterm essays and a final paper.  You can bang out all of them in a couple hours each.
econ/demog c175 was by far the best breadth I took. It was the only breadth I took out of interest (honestly, the ""easy options"" for that breadth were all full that semester, and economic demography sounded interesting enough).

Most of the class was stuff I'd read articles on for fun anyways. I enjoyed like ~half of the readings, and because I had pretty good math intuition and a  decent amount of background knowledge in the subject, I found the class very easy. I took it P/NP, but I probably would've been right on the A-/A border despite not studying for the final at all.

I picked my other breadths based on recommendations for easy classes, and most of them were absolute fucking snooze fests. if you have an inkling of respect for yourself, please don't take anthro 2ac or especially espm 50 ac. unbearably boring. they also weren't any easier.
I‚Äôm a cs major I liked geog50ac it‚Äôs called California and goes into the history of the state and Bay Area. Cool historical context of the Bay Area if ur interested in how tech transformed it
Mostly tedious.

If the 7 Breadth / AC requirement didn't exist, I would voluntarily take **MCB32: Human Physiology** again, but this doesn't apply to your situation probably since you said you know you want to do CS. I had a pre-existing interest in biology/physiology. I could mostly just use my memory from lecture + my bio intuition to make educated guesses on the exams/quizzes/homework so I never had to study. I wrote my term paper on a drug I was microdosing at the time (during the 2016 biohacking trend) so it was fun to have a reason to do more research there. The prof. is a little bit more SJW than I would've liked, but the class is good otherwise. I looked at the most recent syllabus and there's a graded ""medical racism"" component, so YMMV. Different strokes for different folks...

I also liked **History 164A - Early Modern European Philosophy from 1500-1800**, but I wouldn't voluntarily take it if it didn't fulfill a requirement. Again, this was more of a personal interest. It was nice to have a good reason to sit down and actually read Descartes after just being a internet/armchair solipsist. It was also fun to connect some of the people you learn about in Math/Engineering classes to their philosophical contemporaries and see how the ideas of the time were likely cross-pollinated. The downside is lots of papers, written exams and the social component to discussions and other classwork.

Every other class was readings I didn't want to read to write papers I didn't want to write and studying for exams I didn't want to take.
Don‚Äôt take RHETOR R1A
lmaoo that was light af
I‚Äôm a little nervous to take this class in the Fall. I‚Äôm concerned she going to turn the class into a social justice class rather than what it is supposed to be

Nah the only oral component was just interviewing a Muslim person. I just interviewed my mom lol

Two UC Berkeley professors have clashed on Israel-Palestine. War led them to a joint message,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/berkeley-israel-palestine-professors-18429289.php,2023-10-19 17:58:59,,"This article doesn‚Äôt do professor Bazian justice, they spend the entire time sucking off hasner and then just mention Hatem Bazian, he is so much more than what little they seemingly reluctantly write about him. 

Also I watched the entire protest at sproul from the MLK balcony(so I could see everything happening), no rabbi was assaulted and no one did a nazi salute. Counter protesters were laughing because the Israeli protesters were yelling ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù, terrorist‚Äù, etc. at them. The only violence that occurred was when a guy in a red hat ran into the middle of the protest and yelled Free Palestine, he was shoved and that‚Äôs about it. (By the way I wasn‚Äôt a counter protester I just wanted to watch)

Edit: spelling"
What a GOAT loved his class,https://i.redd.it/yzyps9g6nu6a1.jpg,2022-12-18 23:34:22,Will definitely be checking out his medium articles üòéü´∂üèº,"Is this the same guy who bought everyone pizza ?
Whoa, so in 31 years, wages have been flat?

For comparison, I tried to look up the chancellor salary from back then and saw that in 1995 it was $200k ([https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-09-16-mn-46419-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-09-16-mn-46419-story.html)). Inflation adjusted, that would be $390,696.85 today. But Carol Christ's actual salary last year was 538,471.00. So the chancellor's inflation adjusted salary is up 38% over that time period, whereas grad pay was essentially flat according to this professor, until now when there was a \~66% increase. This drives home how important and incredible this strike was!

Sure it was annoying for students, but IMO the few weeks of annoyance was extremely worth it for such a massive step change in TA pay.
Never had a class with him but he sponsored the Palestine decal, one of the best classes I ever took. Cool guy.
Glad to see someone else posting for hatem and you guys enjoyed his class despite the strike.
I didn't know dude was a GSI before.
He came long way from being GSI to have Palestinian studies in his department.
Yup same exact guy genuinely only professor I had who was empathetic to the strike, Hatem Al Baizan is for the people and he‚Äôd always call out the bs at the university that the others didn‚Äôt
Sorry but she is extremely underpaid.

[https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/analysis/2021/05/08/highest-paid-university-presidents/](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/analysis/2021/05/08/highest-paid-university-presidents/)
Now we not only have DeCal but whole Palestinian studies in Middle Eastern department.
I took his two iconic course Muslim in America and Islamophobia. Will take Palestinian DeCal before I graduate.
I have no compensation on her salary, just saying her wages were up 38% in real terms and GSI wages were totally flat until the strike (now up 66%!) and that's amazing.
That really goes to show how much people sacrifice to be at the best public university in the world, since so much of our faculty are outrageously underpaid vs peer institutions as well‚Ä¶I think lecturers (which Hug and Denero used to be) get paid like $70k to teach full time in some of our best departments.


Also annoying when we lose our best profs because we can‚Äôt find the money to pay even half of what Harvard or Stanford throw at them
That's fantastic to hear! Yes, highly highly rec the Palestine DeCal, you'll have a great experience."

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"

Already have 3 MechE classes so an easy A would be nice (actually I'll probably just take it P/NP, so something that'll take little to no effort to pass basically). It's a little overwhelming since I'm coming from a somewhat small cc and it seems like there are a million classes to choose from at berkeley.","Soc 3AC is a very easy class, but if you're in MechE I might suggest Ed 182AC, it's a really easy but also very engaging upper div AC.

Music 26AC is also good, fulfills Arts and Lit for those who need it, but it fills up really quickly.

Lastly, look up berkeleytime, you can sort all the AC courses on the catalog by average grade. Keep in mind they might have prereqs and might be a lot of work, but it can be a helpful tool. Let me know if you find another course you might want to take, I can tell you if it's a lot of work or not.

I would also like a recommendation for an AC course. 
History 7A fulfills the AC and history requirements.  If DeLay is still teaching, then you should definitely take it.  He's a fantastic lecturer and his exams aren't bad
ESPM 50AC with Spreyer was pretty easy and enjoyable.  Can coast through readings for the most part so long as you attend lecture.
Muslims in America was chill. 
Lol is that really a class?
Soc 3AC (easy, interesting, fills soc req if you need it), Music 26AC (easy, fun, fills Arts and Lit req if you need it), Ed 182AC (easy, entire grade is based off discussion section attendance and two papers and I really loved the class, and it fills upper div in humanities req if you're in CoE)
Do you remember which prof?
Much appreciated. 
It's always Hatem Bazian"
