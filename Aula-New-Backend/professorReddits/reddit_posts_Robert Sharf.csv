Thanks for the reply, but Robert Sharf is teaching this semester
> [Robert Sharf](http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/sharf/)

I took a Buddhism class as a junior,  the teacher was really easy going and gave everyone an A for participating.  I did not really understand a thing, but 20 years later the stuff I read  all clicked into place and  made it so much easier for me to deal with change and adversity in a skillful manner.  I hope your experience is similarly awesome, both over days and decades. 



You should definitely email Sharf. Like Presti, most of his classes are basically the same material with different emphases. Sharf also assigns a TON of readings, so if you're adding that class now it might be too late to reasonably catch up."
