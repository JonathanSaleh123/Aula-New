U.C. Berkeley chancellor Robert Birgeneau makes list of 500 most powerful people in the world,http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/the_500_most_powerful_people_in_the_world?page=full,2013-05-01 11:34:18,,"the title of this post makes it seem like Birgeneau created the list himself, as opposed to being selected to be on the list. 
I was a big fan right up until the whole fiasco with the beating of students with clubs.
i think its bs
[deleted]
Can you imagine just him sitting down writing a list with a pencil. 
I read it the same way and thought his sense of self-importance must be enormous to attempt such a task.
thought so too!
It is a shame that only students affiliated with campus clubs got beat. 
elaborate? 
Bachelors of Science?
Robert Birgeneau is the chancellor of one of the most powerful research and educational institutions in the world. Why is it a shock that he's on a list of powerful people?
I'd disagree with that. He's an incredibly charismatic figure with an honest dedication to actively change what he feels is important. It's no wonder that he became Chancellor, despite the fact that he was the first in his family to graduate from high school even.
With a huge smile on his face.
You're confusing what it means to be successful with what it means to be powerful.
And he has the success to do that"

Stupidest ones are bolded. Apparently EVERYONE supports illegal immigration and affirmative action now! If you plan on going to this protest and think it's only about fee hikes for education or something, READ THIS and realize what all you will represent by being there. Not to mention, a lot of these are just plain impossible.

*******************************************************

Occupy Cal’s Demands:

Local Demands
- Respect Free Speech, Including the Right to Set Up Tents.
- **Immediate Resignation of Robert Birgeneau, George Breslauer, Harry LeGrande, and 
Mitch Celaya. ** Democratic Election of their Replacements by Students, Faculty, and Staff.

- Amnesty for All Protesters. 
- **Make UC Berkeley a Sanctuary Campus for Undocumented People. Pass the UC-wide Dream Act.**
- Equal Benefits and Retirement Security for UC Union Workers.

Statewide Demands
- **Reverse the Fee Hikes, Cuts, and Layoffs To At Least Their 2009 Levels.**

- Stop the Attacks on Teachers Unions.","They should also return all the land of the university to the Native American tribe that used to live here, since we're on the topic of being fair.
The protesters really screwed up. There are plenty of people from diverse backgrounds who support the protests against the fee hikes. However, a majority of the other demands are on very polarizing issues, so they will lose a huge amount of support. Honestly, this whole occupy cal thing is extremely naive if they think they have the power to make such major changes - they need to pick one issue and stick with it or else they won't accomplish anything.
Thanks for posting this. What should have been a focused thrust against the police brutality of the previous days has (as expected) become a wishy-washy ""protest all the things"" joke. I am disapoint :(
Why do they want affirmative action?  Does it bother them that Asian American students are over represented at Berkeley?  Admitting more students might sound great but it means that the university will have to reject others, and that burden at Berkeley will fall almost entirely on Asian Americans.
Yeah and a free PhD for everyone in the field of study of their choosing!
Is nobody here aware of the corruption and non-transparency on part of the Regents and Chancellors?  Does everybody here seriously, a-priori accept the power and authority of 26 banking and corporate elite over the University of California?  

Sure, debate the other ones--but seriously, you guys think that demanding structural political reform is silly?  

[Here is a nice essay](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/Minding%20the%20Campus.pdf) by  Professor Emeritus of Physics at Berkeley, expounding upon exactly why there are tuition hikes, and why the Regents and political structure is fucked beyond repair.  
I see four, maybe five reasonable requests here, one of which was already granted.

The affirmative action one in particular makes me glad I decided not to participate in the strike tomorrow.
Democratizing the administration of the UC system is not outrageous or obnoxious.  Affirmative action is largely misunderstood, while I personally have my misgivings about it, there would be no quotas and it would actually have a very small effect, only on the borderline admission cases. ( This is basically a demand from BAMN who seems to be quite over represented in the movement.  Reversing the fee hikes obviously needs to be coupled with revenue raising somewhere, and the consensus about where that should be is pretty resounding.
Immediate forgiveness of all student debt is beyond comprehension, but in a perfect world, education should be free anyways.
[deleted]
UCLA student here. I saw some chalk drawings on campus to the similar effect. ""NO FREE HIKES OR CUTS"". This blows my mind. Where the fuck is the campus supposed to meet the budget?
The list of demands isn't a finalized list. The Occupy Cal movement doesn't just stop here. You will not represent ALL of these ideas by being there. These demands were made to open up the conversation on these issues. Do you all really think the protesters are so naive as to think they can get all these things? The point of a movement like this is to refine over time, and until then, steer the conversation. Some of these have even been achieved in some form (birgeneau granted amnesty to thursday's protesters).

tl;dr occupy cal is an ongoing dialogue.
You obviously know nothing about negotiating.  Ask for everything, settle for half.
the Occupy Cal movement has just lost all legitimacy and credibility in my mind
can someone link me to the event? I want to see thisss
i mean, the demands are largely symbolic. might as well reach for the stars! not sure why they decided on listing demands in the first place, though. the occupy movement has been doing pretty well without them. 
I agree that convoluted/confused messages and demands tend to have a marginalizing effect on the wider student population, and that this has been a big issue in student activism the last few years, but I do not believe that thinking big should be criticized in and of itself. If you want and demand a little bit, you'll get a little bit - such is the shit appeasement is made of. Now, you can also choose to start at the top and work your way downwards towards the practical from there, which in turn could lead to larger absolute gains. 
Thank god US history is not made by you but real wo/men of character. Not idiots who tear down the visionaries because of their own small-mindedness, cowardice, and fear of the baton. Obviously university has been a waste for most of you commenting here.

Now don't bother whining about how *mean* I am because I don't give a shit. If you grow up and realize there is more to life than getting you [random science field] degree, I'll be with the patriots in Oscar Grant and in front of Sproul.    
With the Regents in the way, anything smaller than complete structural reform will be meaningless.  So what if we pass some small fee-hike delay now?  What do you think they'll do next year, after the energy has died down?  

The Regents must go.  

[Here is a nice essay](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/Minding%20the%20Campus.pdf) for a further examination of the failure of the current political structure of the UC.  
Well, the original protest wasn't about police brutality, it was wishy-washy to begin with. I honestly think they WANTED police brutality to happen so they could get more attention and and get other people to blindly support the protesters without even realizing what the cause was. They saw the response police brutality got in Oakland and wanted to make sure they got as much video footage of the cops in Berkeley as possible. Did you notice how literally everyone in those videos has a camera aimed at the cops? And they could have easily accepted the (very generous) compromise by the administration that would have allowed them to stay in Sproul Plaza 24/7 as long as they didn't set up tents. They rejected that and began setting up tents anyway. They knew the cops would start having to use violence, and they provoked them. Yes, the force used was excessive, but it wasn't like they didn't expect it.
Totally ridiculous that ANYBODY would have to feel the burden of affirmative action. You're telling somebody, ""you're smarter than that other guy/girl, but you're the wrong color. Sorry! Admission denied.""

People always forget about that part of affirmative action.
probably the quickest way to get UCB to the status of University of Phoenix.

Excuse me, that's DOCTOR Harley to you, as in doctor of rocket surgery
Thank you! OP is just trying to use sensationalism to discredit the movement and draw attention away from the most important objectives. 
The real issue is student loan reform. The current system is broken, and it risks following the same path as the subprime mortgage crisis, except even worse for the middle class. Student loans are being pushed much more actively and in increasing amounts, the debt can't be defaulted on, and there's less of a guarantee that a college degree can ensure a well-paying job, or any job for that matter.

The current job market is dominated by four-year degree holders, which raises the minimum barrier to entry forcing high school grads to college. The rapidly increasing costs of higher education coupled with the stagnation in wages for the middle class results in the necessity of student loans. On average, students take on over $20,000 in loan debt by the time they graduate. Couple that with the difficulties for new grads to find jobs, and you're basically trying to climb out of a hole before even starting.
Cmon everyone let's grab our share!  Fuck all the people who paid up front or worked through college.  Get your handouts while they're fresh!
How about by [fixing the fiasco that has been the last ten years.](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/Minding%20the%20Campus.pdf)  
A 'Demand' does not sound like an ongoing dialogue. No offense, but are you naïve enough to think that some of the most passionate people about the issues aren't crazy. More crazy than the Regents, but less corrupt and they don't have the money. (The Regents are totally corrupt and I hate them. But they're not crazy.)
I don't see why people try and give shit to the movement, when they're most likely not the ones even participating. If you don't like what you hear, why not go out and do something about it? In the general assembly, everyone has a voice. All you have to do is remember how to use it.
Half of these demands aren't just overshooting - they're stupid and have no principled basis to back them up.  You can ask for everything when you have a good reason.  Asking for complete forgiveness of all student debt has zero justification, as does making the UC a ""sanctuary for illegal immigrants"" in violation of Federal and State law.  You could also ask the state to handout $10k to every protestor while you're at it, that has roughly the same amount of justification behind it - zero.

You negotiate based on principle, not demanding handouts and concessions from people who owe you nothing.  

Me: ""I would like a million dollars.""

Millionaire: ""No.""

Me: ""Comon.""

Millionaire: ""No.""

Me: ""Comooooooooon.""

Millionaire: ""No.""

Me: ""Comoooooooooooooooon.""

Millionaire: ""Fine, you can have five hundred thousand dolllars.""

Me: ""Yes!""

if you're gonna ask for these ridiculous demands, why not just ask for free tuition while you're at it?
That's really not the point here. I would be okay with that if I supported all of these demands, but I don't and I think a lot of others don't as well.

I'm all for reversal of fee hikes and forgiveness of student debt even though I know they're impossible. However I am firmly against affirmative action and I don't support illegal immigration (I have a pretty strong opinion about this as a legal immigrant). I also think the call for forcing our Chancellor's resignation is ridiculous and completely out of line.
This is probably exactly what it's about. The ""extreme"" and polarizing issues will probably make the others (amnesty for arrested protestors, tuition to 2009 levels) more appealing to negotiate.
I think it would have gone over a lot better if they didn't call them ""demands"", but instead referred to them as something along the lines of ""issues of concern"". Calling them ""demands"" is polarizing and makes it seem like there's no possibility of negotiation or debate -- like a child.

Interesting to learn that anybody who thinks affirmative action is racism is not a real wo/man of character. TIL.
Immediate forgiveness of all student debt and full implementation of affirmative action is more than a little crazier than the fact that the Regents are totally crooked, and the state has the wrong priorities. By the way, I totally support those last two ideas.
What does 'they' mean? There were over 500 people who voted at the first general assembly to occupy the campus, and the only thing all 500 people voted on was to establish the camp. Was there a resolution to encourage police brutality? Do you really think 500 people collectively decided to incite police violence? The protests are heterogeneous in their makeup and their beliefs.

'They saw the response police brutality got in Oakland and wanted to make sure they got as much video footage of the cops in Berkeley as possible.' You say this as if this is illogical. The cops then went ahead with a repeat performance of similar brutality.

The administration's compromise was offered HOURS AFTER the first tents were set up (towards the end of the night). What you call ""generous"" is essentially farcical--camping out with no tents, no sleeping bag, and 'no sleeping.' Does that even seem possible?

These protests are something ongoing, and developing. It's a conversation happening, not JUST a push for certain policies.
The ""very generous compromise"" you speak of also included no sleeping or eating.  I stopped by one night--the police were standing guard, watching over the few kids to make sure they didn't fall asleep. It was fucking ridiculous--sleep deprivation of sorts.  

And what is this rather silly argument about how police force is okay if we expect it?  You might as well say that the world ought not be outraged by the massacres taking place in Syria, since of course the protesters ought to expect it!  
I'm just going to jump in here as one of the people that got beat by the police. How fucking dare you say we wanted this to happen. Have you been beaten by the police? It is not fucking fun. Even after the physical effects wear off that shit is fucking traumatizing. Hell, it's traumatizing just to see my fucking friends get beaten by cops, let alone experience it myself.
I use to think this. Affirmative Action does more to correct for the fact that white students out preform minorities on standardized tests. This is true for most standardized tests, from the SATs to the MCATs and GREs. There are a number of possible reasons students of the same academic standing (GPA, Major, etc...) would score disproportionally on a test, and one is definitely stereotype threat. This is an effect where if a minority is made aware that the test is evaluative their performance reliably drops.

Add to this the fact that standardized tests are not useful predicators of later success in the educational system. At best scores on the SAT/LSAT/GRE/etc... can predict the first year of academic performance but no more. Basically, Affirmative Action is a way to account for the inherent bias on standardized testing.
Actually, I think OP is legitimate. A meaningful protest should have a unified, strong message. If a protest has questionable demands mixed in it, then it weakens the impact of the protest.

I interpret the OP as a jumping point for discussion of the message, not simply a post to discredit the movement.
The OP's point is that the organizing minds behind the whole thing are, essentially, insane. While the core messages are quite reasonable, the authors of those demands are not whatsoever.
The only thing that makes you think they aren't corrupt is that they aren't good at getting what they want.
Or I could just oppose your entire ""general assembly"" and ignore your protest, I think that's also a viable option.  Completely forgiveness of all student debt and blanket approval of all illegal immigration just goes to show how retarded the core of this ""assembly"" is.  Real protests against corruption would demand that the bankers and financiers who broke the law should go to prison, not that everyone in California gets a handout.
Ha, yea, that about the gist of what this guy thinks is going to happen.  It's just embarrassing and makes the whole movement look stupid.  Ask for JUSTICE, not handouts, jail for the bankers and financiers that broke the law, not some new entitlements.
Half of them are things that are attainable and seem like they're being sought after (like making Berkeley a safe place to protest). The other half aren't so much ""demands"" as ideas or problems that are being called attention to. The first stuff seems knee-jerk in response to the administration, and I'm surprised there isn't more about the Regents.
[deleted]
I'm curious as to your stance on ""illegals""--whom I like to call ""refugees.""  What is your strong opinion?
How is calling for the chancellor's resignation ridiculous?

He endorsed the use of overwhelming violence against a peaceful protest on the fucking Mario Savio steps of all places, and then went on to describe linking arms and chanting 'stop beating students' as an act of violence.

I can understand criticizing some of the other demands, but calling for Birgeneau's resignation is completely reasonable.  He's disgraced himself and this university and should fuck off.
do the bears on their poster remind anyone of pedobear?
Sorry you have no imagination.
Well that's not what the poster said at all...
I agree, I think we should focus on restructuring the system itself, rather than focus on specific policy demands.  
I don't know about you, but I enjoy nice looking campuses. I don't particularly like one of the coolest parts of campus looking like a shanty town. The rules against encampments are there for a good reason.
Daily Cal : ""The protester added that any violent clashes with police, like what happened Wednesday, “will be beneficial to our cause.”""

http://www.dailycal.org/2011/11/11/occupy-cal-general-assembly-votes-to-set-up-encampment-tuesday/ 
'they' = the organizers who are making these Facebook events, designing the fliers, and pasting thousands of them over what seems like every wall on campus. I know it makes perfect logical sense for this group of people to want to make as big a deal out of this police brutality as possible. I was just clarifying to thrawnie and others who don't know that this movement is not at its core about police brutality. It was and is about the list of grievances above. They are encouraging the police brutality because they know it will make more people come out who don't otherwise support the list of causes. They're going to seem much stronger with all the extra people and media attention than they would have otherwise as just people holding signs for disconnected mostly ridiculous complaints.
You know what, it is a health and safety issue when people are sleeping and eating in the middle of campus DURING the school week. The majority of my friends do not feel comfortable about this, and I think the university is right to want to enforce rules about it.

As for comparing this protest to Syria? Please remember that this is true:

White People make up between 30% to 40% of both UC Berkeley's population and the state's population.  Affirmative action will effect them the least.
[deleted]
Affirmative action is stupid retarded.  It is just as racist to say that if someone belongs to a minority that they must be marginalized in society.  If you really want to make the system fair, simply let the school consider the applicants socioeconomic background, not race.  There are plenty of wealthy minorities, and there are plenty of economically disadvantaged people who live in shitty areas that are part of the racial majority.  Using race is stupid, look at their living situation not their color.
If you can think of a better way to objectively measure students, then let me know. GPA? People who go to community college sometimes get straight A's in joke public schools (i.e., ones full of underperforming students).

But performance on standardized tests isn't the only thing associated with race. So is performance in college. You have the point of view that, ""performance on SAT is associated with race, therefore it must be an incorrect measurement."" You are begging the question (look it up on wikipedia if you are part of the 99% that doesn't know what ""begging the question"" actually means).

I think it's interesting that you think color of skin is a better way to measure students than standardized tests. As in, the same test EVERYONE takes.
Nope, it's called tuition now.
Wonderful! That means it's PERFECTLY reasonable to charge no tuition, no matter what you call it.
My strong opinion: It would be totally fine if it were free and unlimited if the following were true:

1. ""Refugees"" don't get medical expenses paid by the U.S. government. (Think emergency room bills that can never be paid.)
2. ""Refugees"" don't get free education, I.E. paid for by U.S. tax payers.
3. ""Refugees"" don't actually get any free benefits paid for by U.S. tax payers.
4. Law Enforcement is 100% effective and free.

Essentially, free immigration leads to a better economic situation for everyone, unless you have a welfare state, or you assume market failures can exist.
Refugees from what?  From the expenses of paying for legal immigration into this country? You realize that the expenses that every illegal immigrant dodges is another expense on every legal taxpayer?  What about illegal immigrants that drive around without a license or insurance, use emergency medical care without paying for it, undercut legal workers by accepting below minimum wage from businesses... The list goes on.  If I tried to illegally immigrate into Mexico from South America, they wouldn't see me as a refugee, they'd arrest me and deport me.
I can spin it another way:

He endorsed the use of moderate force against an increasingly rowdy crowd of protestors that was obstructing justice--a situation that could have quickly turned violent needed to be controlled.

He also didn't call it an act of violence, he said it was ""not nonviolent""--and considering the historical use of the phrase ""nonviolent protest"", he's right.
Thanks! Here's the evidence for my comment guys. But I guess you will all down vote anyway, shocker.
How have the protesters 'encouraged' police brutality, if i may ask?
Scumbag Reddit: Disagree with well reasoned post? Downvote until only one point of view remains.
Bullshit.  I'm sorry for cursing, but I see no logic in saying that an encampment is a ""health and safety issue"" when basically everybody lives a walking distance from their house from Sproul.  Couple that with the fact that the encampment is not in the way at all of students who are walking to and from class, and you have a pretty weak story there.  

I'm not comparing the protest to Syria--after all, we are not getting killed.  But my statement was the logical extension of your argument, that if protesters know they will face repression, then the protesters deserve it.  

In any case, the logic of the picture as a whole is silly.  So we ought not be discontent with our situation and being marginalized by those in control, since there are other populations who are even more marginalized than us?  This type of thinking is the very reason why stratifications exist--it was used during the beginning of the slave era, to split apart disenfranchised whites and blacks by creating a new racial hierarchy, and you are seemingly using it now to de-legitimize protest in the 1st world.  
 
Wait you're saying he can't compare this protest to Syria because you posted a picture of ""poor"" Somalian Children as the 99%? And a white guy as the 1%? Whats your point?

I have to assume from here. Is it that we can't have problems because there are ""starving"" and ""poor"" individuals elsewhere? Also I would like to mention you're probably performing some savage Orientalism there, suggesting that Syria is in the same state as Somalia and even to stereotype Somalia as the go-to fucked up place in the world.

Is the UC System fucked up? Yes. Does Syria have it worse? Probably. Does Somalia have it worse them both of them? Most likely.

If we have problems we should fix them. Some problems are worse and should require more attention, yes. But that ULTIMATELY should not stop us from fixing problems.

The worst part is most of the people who use this argument, probably couldn't care less about Syria, Somalia, etc.

So what are the causes in your opinion?
Socioeconomic is definitely a better way to look at things, but I think you should realize that race has a part in socioeconomics. 
So you already start of by saying that one needs monetary assets to legally immigrate into the United States--enforcing the idea that immigration across borders is a privilege reserved for the wealthy and/or privileged.  I'd like to see you tell that to people who have had their livelihoods destroyed by the flood of US-subsidized agricultural products into Mexico after the passage of NAFTA.  Or perhaps you should tell it to the people whose lives have been torn apart by the violence of the drug war, fueled by demand from First World citizens?  

I call bullshit on the arguments that refugees costs the US taxpayer.  Refugees pay sales tax--that is unavoidable.  And their work is the foundation of most of US agricultural work; recall that several state's [farming industries collapsed](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/georgias-new-immigration-law-leading-to-crops-rotting-in-farmers-fields/) due to the passage of draconian documentation laws.  

Get out of here, bougy!      
Baton blows to the abdomen do not constitute moderate force.  I haven't been able to find UCPD's version of it, but every use of force continuum I have ever seen puts baton blows to the abdomen just one step below lethal force - and considers them more forceful than tasers, tear gas, pepper spray, soft and hard hand control, and pretty much anything else.  Short of literally just shooting us baton blows to the abdomen were the most severe form of possibly legitimate force they could have used. (I don't consider it to actually have been legitimate force, but it is a convenient word here to distinguish between ""force that could be appropriate in some situation"" and ""force that could never be appropriate"" - like just beating our faces in.)

Calling the crowd 'increasingly rowdy' is a load of shit.  If UCPD and ACSO feel that they cannot control a crowd of 250 students that are literally just chanting slogans at them, they are so inexcusably bad at their jobs that they should resign in shame.  At the time that the worst violence of the day started, the police were literally at 1:1 parity with the protesters.  They could have handcuffed and removed each and every one of us with barely any effort.  The crowd was not violent and presented no form of threat - as well demonstrated by the lack of serious incidents yesterday, when twenty times as many people were in Sproul.  

Birgeneau called it ""not nonviolent,"" UCPD has been explicitly calling it violent.  Both are ridiculous.  Linking arms and chanting 'stop beating students' is nonviolent by any reasonable definition of the term.
Recognizing that violence against protesters works in their favor is a far stretch from the notion that they're actively trying to incite violence to gain support. Your comment is still simple conjecture (in the context of the group's goals as a whole). I'm sure some students feel that way, but that doesn't mean it holds for all or even a majority of the protesters.
Not going to downvote, but you don't know anything about the history and rhetoric of protests, do you? Being the victims of violence is one of the most powerful tools, especially if it's inflicted by your enemy when you don't fight back. Not saying who is right or wrong on the police violence (I personally disagree that it was necessary at all), but you seriously can't possibly be naïve enough to think that they didn't want police brutality.

EDIT: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buovLQ9qyWQ
720,000 views in ~5 days? You can't say that doesn't help their cause.
I agree with you. Everyone cites its a ""Health and Safety issue."" But honestly its just a excuse for them to use violent force. If its really was a health and safety issue then the city, the school should use funds to encourage them to occupy in a safe and healthy way. 

Paying cops overtime to prepare and then break up a raid? Probably much more expensive than actually providing aid to occupiers.
I apologize for my misspelling and lack of actual hard data earlier.
My statement was based on the assumption that affirmative action seeks to allow access proportional to the population.  If you see it differently please let me know so that I understand you opinion better.  As you can see from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_California) ""According to 2010 US Census California's population was 40.1% Non-Hispanic White, 5.8% Black or African American, 12.8% Asian, 4% American Indian, 2% Pacific Islander and 2.6% from two or more races. 37.6% of the total population are Hispanics or Latinos of any race.""
	                     Undergraduate	Graduate	
African American	     4%	                3%	      
Asian American	     42%	                17%	     
White American	     31%	                42%	   
Hispanic American	     12%	                6%	        
Native American	     <1%	                1%	
International student 4%	                18%	
I was wrong the differences between state and university population are greater for white undergraduates than for African American students.  If you are realistic you should fight an affirmative action system which will let in even more unintelligent students who can not spell.
Exactly. If race matters for the individual student, it will show up in their socioeconomic background. Race has already been implicitly factored into UC admissions this way. It just should not become an explicit factor in admissions.
Yep, immigration is a privilege reserved for people who can afford it.  Kind of like, I don't know, food, or fresh water, or the computer you're on right now.  There is no something for nothing in this world.  Someone is paying for it, somewhere.  Sure, they pay sales tax, but if you get into a car accident with an illegal and they drive away because they don't have insurance (or for that matter, a license), you'll wish that they paid what a regular citizen was require to pay.  Immigration should be made more affordable, but this does not justify illegal immigration, it justifies immigration reform.  As for the drug war, you're preaching to the choir here.  That doesn't justify illegal immigration at all though, it just shows that we need to legalize drugs and put an end to one of the most senseless drains on money, lives, and freedom on the continent.  

The whole farming argument isn't very compelling to me.  So when farmers who pay low wages to workers because they're illegal go out of business, this is a big problem?  Sounds like it's just a failed business that relied on artificially low labor costs.  I don't think agriculture in this country is going to collapse, don't worry.
""So you already start of by saying that one needs monetary assets to legally immigrate into the United States--enforcing the idea that immigration across borders is a privilege reserved for the wealthy and/or privileged.""

The problem is that everyone except Mexicans DOES have to be wealthy and privileged in order to be granted even the opportunity to visit America. Do you know anything about the long and arduous process of getting visas and applying for permanent residency in America? You can't even think of immigrating to the US from any other part of the world unless you have a job already secured and a high stable income. Even then, you have to deal with quotas and long waiting lines. 

There is a reason why the Asians and Indians who make it to America tend to be the smart and successful ones. If you just opened US borders to all, you would be immediately flooded by millions and millions of people from across the world who would drop everything for the chance to live in America. Mexicans aren't the only ones that have had difficult lives. Secure the borders completely or make them open to everyone. It's hypocrisy to call illegal immigrants ""refugees"" and fund their college educations while closing the door on the rest of the world. 
Yeah sorry, I clarified this in another post. By 'they' I mean the organizers, not everyone at the protest.
This isn't necessarily connected to the events on campus, but I think it's interesting to relate your ideas with the usage of agent provocateurs against protests.
I'm not arguing with the rhetorical logic--that is sound. We've all seen how the media has grabbed onto the youtube videos whereas before they wouldnt even bat an eyelash at the issues with the regents.
 It's the idea of 'encouraging' police brutality that I don't understand. Does this involve asking a cop to hit you? What does the term 'encouraging' mean in your context?

I agree with socioeconomic background. But our metrics for socioeconomic background fall short. When you talk about Socioeconomic background you're talking about, where you grew up, how much your parents made, did they go to college, etc. Race can be one of these factors.

What I think the problem is, is that people are reducing this process to simply race. That's not what they're going to be doing. They're looking at race because it is included in one's socioeconomic background, but they're also looking at a great deal of other things that make up one's socioeconomic background.

Race is considered in this process, but one shouldn't believe its all race. 
I think we are getting a little skewed as to what ""justifies"" illegal immigration.  Let me re-frame the discussion a little bit.

I believe it is obscene for us--like you said, who are privileged to have fresh food, water, and computers--to tell people living in destitute conditions what they are and are not justified in doing.  If I was in a country whose economy had been wrecked, and where violence is the norm, I am going to move, and I don't care what kind of abstract socio-economic standard of morality my logic violates.  

Furthermore, you are still not offering much substantive evidence that refugees are a drag on the taxpayer--[they pay into Social Security](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/05/business/05immigration.html), we have both agreed that they pay sales tax, and, most important of all:  they're here to work.   Can I say that again? *They're here to work.*  And like you said, they work for artificially low wages because they have no protection from public regulation or that sort of thing.  And they still make up a [significant percentage of our labor pool.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5250150).  

In other words, I am still not seeing any reason to buy into your argument that refugees are a drag on the economy and the taxpayer, other than the fact that you might crash into one and have to pay a bit more for insurance.    
Your logic would make sense, except that it ignores the systemic ways through which the United States has decimated the Mexican state through  free-trade treaties and the empowerment of drug cartels.  The same is true to an extent for many other Latin American nations as well.  

Even in a neo-liberal framework, free flow of immigration is a prerequisite.  You cannot have free trade without the free flow of labor.

I am not for complete free flow of immigration, of course; that has a whole host of problematic issues.  What I am for, however, is recognizing the context of illegal immigration from the South as a result of socio-economic violence, and treating them like people.    
Different in every situation. Many protests have the goal, stated or not, to be the victims of police brutality. Sometimes, you're not willing to do that much to provoke it; the less you do to provoke it, the more effective the rhetoric. For example, being beaten by the police for standing with arms locked is doing very little to provoke the police. It's hilarious that the police tried to claim that linking arms is violent protests.

Other times the bait for the police won't work. For example, if the cops hadn't beaten the people at all, linking arms or not, the message would not go nearly so far. As a result, some groups will be willing to do more, such as throwing bricks at the police. It's more effective at inviting violence, but makes the protesters look worse.

In conclusion, different groups are willing to do different things to encourage police brutality. And police react differently in many situations. (If they don't do anything, then the story doesn't make the news.)

I must say, the protesters in Berkeley are lucky that the cops used violence with such little provokation. I think it was idiodic to play into the hands of the protesters like that, but given how many crazy/homeless/militant-hippies exist in Berkeley, they would have camped out for weeks anyway. And I gotta say, I don't like the look of Sproul plaza with a Shanty town. Not a fan of the 'slum' look, personally.
Thank you for explaining, I would agree that socioeconomic status and the high school that applicants attend is important.  I also see one problem with your explanation.  I am in the College of Engineering so I don't know any Jenny Doe's.  But in the dorms last year I meet a few and I don't really want them here anyway.
What's wrong with excluding race from your metrics?  You are still getting 90% of the picture from the student, and race does not correlate as well as other metrics for academic disadvantage.  I don't think that it helps the situation as much as most affirmative action people seem to think it will.  In fact I think it mostly creates more division and drama, and promote distrust and bitterness between races.
Weeks? You underestimate hippie determination. How long did people live in those trees by Memorial Stadium?
They built that nice walkway from the courtyard place just off Bancroft to the Sproul Plaza steps and now I can't use it half the time because of Occupy
But I don't think you can accurately say you're getting the 90% picture. I, however, do agree the AA might create more division and drama.

CS 70 (Satish Rao, Babak Ayazifar) [Rating: 6/10]
- Not my favorite course, but honestly nothing terrible about it either
- The content you learn is relatively useful
- Notes are very dense and hard to digest, but if you understand them you will do well
- Rao was okay at lecturing, active on Piazza, down to earth
- Ayazifar was a good lecturer, seemed passionate about teaching and made it interesting
- Homeworks were very long, ruined almost all of my Fridays/Saturdays
- You will do well if you put enough time into the class, but the amount of time it takes might not be worth it to some people
- How to do well: do past exams, be up-to-date on lectures, go to discussions to put concepts into practice
- Workload: 10-20 hours/week

DATA 100 (Fernando Perez, Alvin Wan) [Rating: 2/10]
- I really wanted to like this course: it went from being my favorite class this semester to being the worst class I have ever taken
- The content you learn is very practical and useful
- The lack of effort put into refreshing the recycled lectures was disheartening, but the lectures were otherwise good and not hard to follow
- Labs were well-written and generally useful
- Homeworks were still useful but not as well-written
- Discussions felt like a waste of time to me, basically a rehash of lecture but worse and the worksheets did not teach me much
- The midterm was @#$% and not at all representative of how well you learned the material
- The final project experience really depends on your group, I personally had to work way harder because of some group members who contributed nearly nothing
- How to do well: the reason the class sucked this semester is because you could understand the material perfectly well, work hard, and still get a bad grade. I personally ended up with a good grade, but sunk so much time into the final project that I didn't have time to study for my other classes. My recommendation is to take this course with a professor that probably cares more (e.g. Hug in Spring 2022)
- Workload: 8 hours/week normally, 25 hours/week during final project

PHYSICS 7B (Robert Birgeneau) [Rating: 2/10]
- Another one of my least favorite courses
- You don't learn much relevant material in this course (at least for computer science)
- Birgeneau seemed like a nice, well-intentioned professor, but unfortunately the lectures were almost useless in preparing you for exams
- Out of the 180-200 people enrolled in the class, only about 10 showed up to lecture near the end of the semester
- They sent out a survey for feedback on lectures since attendance was low, but there were only about 2 weeks of classes left, so this was quite insulting
- Discussions were also relatively useless if you didn't already understand the material—most people I knew only showed up to get the bonus points for attending >50% of discussions
- Labs were the most engaging part of the class for me and taught useful concepts, but there were only 4 and they did not help me prepare for exams
- Homeworks could have been useful for preparing for exams, but I was more concerned about getting a good grade since getting anything wrong lost points
- Exams tested nothing conceptual—the best way I can put it is that they were a test of how well you could memorize formulas and perform calculus calculations
- How to do well: the class was as close to a textbook as you could get. Read the textbook thoroughly, especially when it shows derivations. Do the example problems in each section because these will often show up on the exams
- Workload: 8-12 hours/week (depends on how long you spend on the textbook, whether there is an upcoming lab or exam)

ETHSTD 175 (Greg Choy) [Rating: 9/10]
- I liked this class a lot, it was refreshing compared to the rest of my classes this semester
- You learn about a lot of history and literature that you probably know/have heard/wouldn't be surprised about, but that you probably haven't discussed before
- Choy was a great lecturer, and super reasonable in his approach to teaching
- There are no assignments besides reading (which is quite heavy, but you could honestly get away with some light skimming)
- The ""midterms"" were super chill, could usually work in groups and were basically short essays that you had a week to work on
- The great thing about this class is that it's more concerned with you learning something than with scoring you—I learned even while writing and discussing the exam questions with my group and you can't really say that for many other classes
- There was an end-of-semester poetry presentation where you/your group gets to be the lecturer for ~30 min
- How to do well: just attend and pay attention in all lectures, take notes, do the readings and you will definitely do well. That being said, you get out of the class as much as you put in, so you may also want to participate by asking questions, discussing during class, etc.
- Workload: 6-12 hours/week (depends on what readings are assigned and how thoroughly you read them)","Yo its Christmas. Take a load off from thinking about school work and spend time with friends and family if you can. You deserve it!

The Chancellor's response to yesterday's protests:,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/m86gz/the_chancellors_response_to_yesterdays_protests/,2011-11-10 17:51:14,"To the Extended UC Berkeley Community:

As you know, yesterday an effort was made to establish an encampment on Sproul Plaza, by the ""Occupy Cal"" movement.  This followed and marred the aftermath of an impressive, peaceful noontime rally on Sproul on behalf of public education, which was attended by some 3,000 participants and observers, including many campus leaders. We compliment the organizers and speakers for setting an example of peaceful protest and mobilization.  As we informed the campus community earlier this week, we understand and share the concern of the Occupy movement about the extreme concentration of wealth in US society and the steady disinvestment in public higher education by California and other States.

We want to clarify our position on ""no encampments"" so you better understand why we do not allow this to occur on our campus.  When the no-encampment policy was enacted, it was born out of past experiences that grew beyond our control and ability to manage safely.  Past experiences at UC Berkeley, along with the present struggles with entrenched encampments in Oakland, San Francisco, and New York City, led us to conclude that we must uphold our policy.

This decision is largely governed by practical, not philosophical, considerations.  We are not equipped to manage the hygiene, safety, space, and conflict issues that emerge when an encampment takes hold and the more intransigent individuals gain control.  Our intention in sending out our message early was to alert everyone that these activities would not be permitted.  We regret that, in spite of forewarnings, we encountered a situation where, to uphold our policy, we were required to forcibly remove tents and arrest people.

We want to thank our student leaders, faculty, and community members who worked hard to maintain a peaceful context last night.  We have been in discussions with the ASUC, Graduate Assembly, and other student leaders who have provided a number of alternative proposals for working with the student protesters.  One such discussion led last night to our offering protesters the opportunity to use Sproul Plaza 24/7 for one week, as a venue for gathering and discussing the issues.  However, we stipulated that no tents, stoves, and sleeping bags would be allowed.  They could gather in Sproul for discussion, but not for sleeping.  This was rejected by a vote of the mass of the protesters.

It is unfortunate that some protesters chose to obstruct the police by linking arms and forming a human chain to prevent the police from gaining access to the tents.  This is not non-violent civil disobedience.  By contrast, some of the protesters chose to be arrested peacefully; they were told to leave their tents, informed that they would be arrested if they did not, and indicated their intention to be arrested.  They did not resist arrest or try physically to obstruct the police officers' efforts to remove the tent.  These protesters were acting in the tradition of peaceful civil disobedience, and we honor them.

We regret that, given the instruction to take down tents and prevent encampment, the police were forced to use their batons to enforce the policy.  We regret all injuries, to protesters and police, that resulted from this effort.  The campus's Police Review Board will ultimately determine whether police used excessive force under the circumstances.

We call on the protesters to observe campus policy or, if they choose to defy the policy, to engage in truly non-violent civil disobedience and to accept the consequences of their decisions.

We ask supporters of the Occupy movement to consider the interests of the broader community---the tens of thousands who elected not to participate in yesterday's events. We urge you to consider the fact that there are so many time-tested ways to have your voices heard without violating the one condition we have asked you to abide by.

Harry LeGrande, Vice Chancellor for Studies Affairs","TL;DR: Linking arms is violence, but beating with batons is an acceptable means for enforcing no camping rules.

Such bullshit. 

""We ask supporters of the Occupy movement to consider the interests of the broader community---the tens of thousands who elected not to participate in yesterday's events."" 

They're twisting intentions and twisting the apathy, ignorance, and inability of people for their own uses. Don't let this change your view on it. There were plenty of times when the police shoved back students for nothing at all, even when they weren't protecting tents.

Don't let them deter the Occupation. 
There seems to be a lot of anger towards the university administration, e.g. in the comments here. I feel like people think the administration is out to get them, for some reason, but in reality the people at the top are just professors who have volunteered to put their own precious research projects on hold so that they can do what they feel like is their duty, and give back to the academic community. If you have ever experienced the inner workings of an academic department, you'll know that most of the time, nobody actually wants to be the chair, or the dean, or the provost, etc. Often the community has to pressure individual people into accepting these posts, and they accept because they feel honor-bound to do so. 

At the very top, this goes to the extreme: Prof. Birgeneau, Prof. Breslauer, and Prof. LeGrande have entirely set aside the personal researches that they've spent their whole lives buildling, to serve the community. I think they deserve some more respect that they are getting. People look at their messages and immediately look for holes, or things to criticize. But these administrators are really trying to do what's best for all the students here at Berkeley! It's just not that easy.
He said dont build tents and they built tents.
The police told them they were under arrest and they resisted arrest.
I dont sympathize with the occupy movement anymore, and its not because I can't sympathize with the 99%.
I stopped sympathizing because the protestors are being inflammatory and expect everyone to drop everything and let chaos reign.

I came here to go to school. Stop making that not happen, guys. Seriously.
Man I just played through the last few levels of half life 2, this guy's rhetoric is startlingly similar to that of Dr. Breen's.  Deliciously sugar coated hoarse shit.
I clicked the link expecting to have my high regard for chancellor birgeneau confirmed.

[deleted]
Not so easily... there were hundreds of them, and they had arms linked so cuffing would not be possible without use of force to separate them. I'm not saying that their level of force used was necessary, but I am saying that the strategy of ""just arrest everyone and then get to the tents"" was extremely impractical, and in that period of time that it took to arrest everybody, not only would the Alameda police department be extremely bottlenecked, but also many tents could have been set up, making the breaking-up of the encampment exponentially more difficult. It was fully within their power to use force in this situation, regardless of whether the level of force they used was appropriate, which is exactly what the Chancellor notes here.
>The cops could have easily arrested individual protestors without using their batons.

Why do people continue to say this? Sure, the cops can arrest the first 20 individuals they see, but this won't deter the hundreds other who will no doubt take their place and only be more motivated to cause a ruckus. As unfortunate as it is, there's a reason cops use violence. 

What is wrong with that sentence you quoted? Sure there were a lot of people at the protest, but there were tens of thousands of Berkeley students and others who would have preferred the protest to not happen at all. Maybe you're surrounded by people who promote this protest, but most students I know would rather be able to go to their classes in peace and not be bothered by continuous helicopters and news coverage that does not exactly paint Berkeley in a positive light.
Bullshit.  Pardon my irritation, but [looking at these facts](http://teachthebudgetdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/teach_the_budget_fall20111.pdf) that the grad students at UCSC compiled up, I am very content in blaming the administration.  


>But these administrators are really trying to do what's best for all the students here at Berkeley! It's just not that easy.

So we shouldn't be angry that people were unjustly beaten last night because 'their jobs are hard'? Hey, then maybe we should never question the President's decisions either!
>The police told them they were under arrest and they resisted arrest.

No they didn't. They threatened to put them under arrest, then they beat them. 

>I stopped sympathizing because the protestors are being inflammatory and expect everyone to drop everything and let chaos reign.

How exactly are the protesters causing you to drop anything?
I don't understand how your school work has been impeded by this protest in particular. Compared to past protests, this one has taken place outside of academic areas. If you don't want to be involved, don't be involved. 
You seem to be under some strange impression that the administration should be listened to no matter what. 

The protestors sought to establish encampments so that they might hold colloquium on the privatization of the campus in the face of its recent budgetary problems -- but also to provide physical presence to many scattered individuals that represent the movement. The administration--under the guise of no-camping policies in place to deter the homeless from gathering on campus--sought to restrict these dialogues.

The ""administration said so, so don't do it"" argument rests some unsettling lap-dog logic; when you fundamentally disagree with the administration and its recent and looming decisions, when you oppose it, and it opposes you, you can't simply do as it says. You can't lay down and play nice while tuition goes up and up.

It's alarming to me that anyone would under any circumstances try to rationalize the physical action recently taken by UC police. 
>I came here to go to school.

That's fine, but some people came here to get an education AND to participate in Berkeley's long history of activism, and I've yet to see how these specific protests are stopping anyone from getting an education. It's also a bit ironic that you condemn the protestors for being inflammatory when you're basically painted them as anarchists.

>the protestors expect everyone to drop everything and let chaos reign.
Why isn't it civil disobedience?
What the Chancellor does here is passive aggressively excuse the use of excessive force. 

>We regret that, given the instruction to take down tents and prevent encampment, the police were forced to use their batons to enforce the policy.

This is bullshit. The police were not forced to use their batons.

>We ask supporters of the Occupy movement to consider the interests of the broader community---the tens of thousands who elected not to participate in yesterday's events.

This is creating a victim where there is no victim. No one was inconvenienced or adversely affected by the protest except the protesters themselves, who were beaten.
You don't have to arrest everyone. Just start arresting people. If they resist arrest, then use reasonable force to subdue them. 
Uh no.

You don't have to beat the shit out of someone to separate a human chain. 
The only thing this deterred me from doing is respecting the response from the PD and the University. If they had just started arrested students, my reaction would have been along the lines of ""fucking hippies!"" Now I feel bad for them.
>but there were tens of thousands of Berkeley students and others who would have preferred the protest to not happen at all.

Really? How much did this disrupt student activity? How was the protest any different than the typical crush of activity going on in Sproul?

>but most students I know would rather be able to go to their classes in peace and not be bothered by continuous helicopters and news coverage that does not exactly paint Berkeley in a positive light.

You never get to your classes in peace walking through Sproul. How did these protests paint Berkeley in a negative light?
I'm sorry, you must be new here. Have you never heard of Berkeley before and its history of protest and civil unrest? Regardless of whether you think these protests ""paint Berkeley in a non positive light,"" (which, by the way is your, opinion; other students may be, I don't know, proud that people are standing up for what they believe?) unfortunately for you and people who share your opinion, and who feel so inconvenienced by the mere fact that a protest is occurring, it is the right of these students to protest non-violently. In fact, I'd be a bit disappointed if a fellow Berkeley student didn't want a protest to happen simply because they didn't agree with their views, let alone not wanting it to happen simply because it was ""inconvenient.""

I'm terribly sorry that you had to *see* the protests and had to *hear* about it on the news.
That may be completely true, but it's ridiculous to assume that the students who did not go are against the protest.
Well we also have the right to comment when we see sensationalist news and videos showing up everywhere that label every Berkeley student as pro-protest and horrified by the all the ""police brutality"".

They pulled fire alarms in buildings around campus during the protest.  That is interference with education.
You seem to be under the strange impression that not following the rules will not result in consequences? Why did they need tents? Why didn't they just sit out on the Plaza? This whole thing would have been circumvented if they didn't set up tents and just occupied without tents.

It's alarming to me that you think that if you break the rules, people will stand by idly and watch.
>You can't lay down and play nice while tuition goes up and up.

Then you can't expect for administration to do the same either. Do you really think they would have let people camp out after they specifically said not to? 

>It's alarming to me that anyone would under any circumstances try to rationalize the physical action recently taken by UC police

What people don't remember is that they are just following orders from above. You want someone to blame? Blame whoever gives the ""use violence if they get out of control"" order. Yes, the individuals could have backed down and rebelled against their orders, but they got themselves and their families to feed not to mention the shunning they would face from their fellow officers if they were to go against the collective. They sure as hell aren't going to put some snot nosed hipsters beliefs before their priorities; not many people would do that.

This is actually clearly false... direct evidence from myself: 
A protester pulled a fire alarm in Dwinelle in the middle of my 8 PM midterm. We all had to sit outside in the cold for about 40 minutes, then went back inside and finished the midterm 40 minutes later than we should have, and it will probably end up not counting due to the high probability of cheating occurring during those 40 minutes outside, thus inconveniencing us another 2 hours when we take a new midterm.

So yes, there were inconveniences caused by the protests, as usual.  
If their bodies are forming a physical barrier, you actually do have to arrest everyone. And why do you say that resisting arrest vs resisting the taking down of tents are any different? They are both obstruction of justice, and the police can use reasonable force to deal with either.
When was the last time that you tried separating two strong, passionate, young adult college students who had their arms linked? And did you do it 100 times? 

Also how do you define ""beat the shit out of?"" I actually have absolutely no evidence regarding the severity of the injuries of those beaten. Are we talking broken bones? Internal bleeding? Or just a couple of bruises? In the latter I would not call it ""beat the shit out of,"" but in the former case I certainly would, so it's hard for me to argue for or against.
Think about what is going on here. The protesters are all clearly in favor of this cause. There probably (or definitely) exist people that are NOT in favor of this cause. By staging this protest, the people who are not in favor of the protest clearly would not support it. The people who are not in favor of the protest would not like it if the rest of the world saw UC Berkeley painted in this light, and make the conclusion ""this is what Berkeley students are like."" Nobody is saying that you do not have the right to protest. What is being said is that protests are almost inherently negative to those who are not supportive of the cause. That is all. That is the point. 
""Sure there were a lot of people at the protest, but there were tens of thousands of Berkeley students and others who would have preferred the protest to not happen at all.""

You're right, it is ridiculous which is why he didn't say that.

Who did? How do you know it was protestors and not people who wanted to pull a fire alarm for any number of reasons and knew it would get blamed on the protestors?
Not sure why the scornful, dickish syntactic parallelism -- but OK. At any rate. People seem to be missing the point; the consequences themselves are the problem. The fact that anyone could think these consequences were acceptable... that's what's beyond me, completely. 

Also, the administration did not want them there for any extended period *at all*; they forbade eating, fires, sleeping, and subsequently sleeping bags and tents. Two of these activities occur daily on Sproul. It's pretty clear that this was simply a tactic by the administration to restrict the rights of speech and freedom to assemble that the students and faculty were exercising.

I'm going to ask you something: what would you do if an administrative power that you saw as unjust--even corrupt--tried to foist upon you policy, rule, or law that you strongly disagreed with? Would you just do as they say, quietly, but begrudgingly? 

Mind, I am not talking about the UC administration; I am just wondering if you can conceive of such powers or circumstances.
Not laying down and playing nice for protestors includes setting up encampments in order to establish a physical presence on the plaza and promote dialogue. Not laying down and playing nice for the administration consists of, evidently, assaulting students and faculty who hold contrary views.

Consider the civil rights movement, whose intentions I am sure you agree with. Those people fought for what they believed in. Many were blacklisted, injured, and even killed for doing so. I realize that the UCPD were put in a difficult situation; the same sort that prevents any of the maintenance staff on campus from participating in the strikes or protests lest they be fired.  

I am not criticizing, necessarily, the UCPD, but rather the power structure in place that allows these things to happen, and further, reacts to oppositional force with violence. I don't mean to drag into the conversation the bulk of the civil rights movement, only to use it to articulate that single point -- but I just wanted to make it clear that opposition, particularly peaceful opposition, should not be met with violence.

And, please, go down there and talk to people / inform yourself before condemning everyone involved as ""snot-nosed hipsters"".
Looking at how [Albany's police handled their orders from above](http://thinkprogress.org/special/2011/10/24/352228/albany-police-defy-orders-and-refuse-to-arrest-occupy-albany-protesters-these-people-were-not-causing-trouble/), I am very comfortable in expecting the police to resist these kinds of orders.  
>They sure as hell aren't going to put some snot nosed hipsters beliefs before their priorities

Did you even *go* to the protest? Do you actually have any idea what the demographic was there? Do you actually have any idea about what you're talking about?
It seems to me that if your argument relies on one author's narrow definition of a term, you do not have a very good argument.
First of all, it's disingenuous to claim that tens of thousands of students were adversely affected by the protest.

Second, it is ridiculous to castigate an entire protest because one asshole pulled a fire alarm. The protest did not cause that guy to pull a fire alarm. You might be able to make the case that it gave the guy an opportunity to pull the fire alarm, but that is such an absurd reason to attack something. If an earthquake gives someone the opportunity to pull a fire alarm I don't blame the earthquake.

Third, nothing you've brought up contradicts the fact that the police used excessive force.
How do you know it was a protestor and not someone who either 1. wanted to cause problems just for fun and knew it would get blamed on the protests or 2. someone who didn't study for the test and knew it would get blamed on the protests. I've had fire alarms pulled during tests before when protests were not taking place. Correlation does not imply causation.
Because the amount of force that is considered reasonable to subdue someone resisting arrest is much greater than that to get someone to move so you can remove a tent. 

edit: and if they arrest some people and the rest do not disperse, then sure arrest all of them. What's stopping them from doing that? Just have the paddy wagons make round trips to the police station.
Your argument is that use of batons was necessary because arresting them the way that cops arrest people every day would have been too *inconvenient*. Arresting 100 ""strong, young, passionate, young adult college students"" would be too difficult. You're right, I don't think the police are in any physical condition, not to mention trained, to arrest resisting criminals.
I was arrested on Oct 25th at Occupy Oakland while in a human chain. I guess the officer who did it must have been Samson.

The second part of your comment is pure, willful ignorance. Videos of the beatings are top paged on /r/politics, /r/occupywallstreet, and /r/berkeley.
>When was the last time that you tried separating two strong, passionate, young adult college students who had their arms linked?

How does that justify beating peaceful protesters? 

>Are we talking broken bones?

It's being reported that someone named Josh Anderson was rushed to the hospital during the beatings. I'm also sure that you've seen the video of the protest beatings circulating. How do you consider what you've seen not being 'beat the shit out of'?
And I'm sure a lot of people were upset when the UC Berkeley Republicans set up their bake sale to satirize affirmative action because they didn't want their school shown in that light. It goes both ways. What do you propose we do about it? Ban all protests?
But just for the hell of it, I'm one of those who is against the protest, sees no message, and worries for the safety of those involved and in over their heads.
We also had fire alarms pulled during the protest last year.  There is no proof but the two events seem related.
Move out of the country. I moved out of China after Tienanmen Square.
Thank you for your response! I don't personally blame the police (and you explain it succinctly by mentioning the power structure) but I still defend the ""civil disobedience"" that happened that night because it was necessary.
Well first of all, the general environment of chaos that is established by an on-campus protest can definitely be attributed to the protest itself. I have never had a fire alarm pulled during a class EXCEPT when there was a large protest happening on-campus on that day. I'm not ruling out the possibility that it was just some person unprepared for the midterm, but it seems very likely to me that it would not have happened if not for the protest. I've taken many midterms in much harder classes before and never had this happen.

And besides, it makes no sense to argue that ""no one was inconvenienced or adversely affected by the protest"" in the first place. If that were really true, then what would be the point of the protest? The POINT is to annoy people, to draw attention, to get in people's way so that they notice you. I personally don't mind the protest all that much, but what about people that use Sproul for other things, or people that are bothered by loud noises and crowds? Or people that go to Berkeley and don't want to be associated with the protests but have no choice? Or the campus staff which have to deal with the protesters themselves + the mess they might make + take care of getting rid of them when encampment is imminent? It just makes no sense. Whether or not I'm for or against it, you cannot possibly argue that the protest does not inconvenience anybody.
Arresting hundreds of students? Taking up police officers' time and resources when they could be doing far more important things? That doesn't seem very reasonable but I suppose they could do it.

Honestly if I was in that situation, I would rather get beaten and walk away with bruises than have a criminal record, but I suppose I shouldn't speak for the people who actually did get beaten.
Videos of the beatings do not convey any information whatsoever as to the severity of the injuries. I also don't see the point in insulting me when I am admitting that I don't know enough to continue the discussion. I am trying to be reasonable and ask questions that should be asked, and instead of just answering them you are taking jabs at me.
Is that even remotely close to what I've said at all? Did I ever once claim that I would like to ban protests? Or that I would like to put an end to Occupy Cal? Please tell me where I either claimed that or even heavily implied it, because I don't think I ever did. I have absolutely no desire to put an end to the protest. But the bake sale example showcases that it is obviously and trivially true that a protest, even if you are not physically near it / it does not physically affect you, can have negative consequences to those not in support of it.

I don't think that that's a preferred--or even viable option--for many of the students. Further, I hope you realize that this is a country worth fleeing *to* because people have, in the past, fought against administrative powers for what they believed was right.

Go down to Sproul and ask around. Ask for fliers, handouts, essays. Even better, find involved faculty and go to their office hours. Get involved and try to understand the situation rather than so quickly condemning or judging those involved. Sure, a lot of the kids are uninformed, or caught up in emotional / political rhetoric, but there are some very objectionable forces at work here.
Protests are never pretty, civil unrest is never fun and happy and trying to change things is always going to 'inconvenience' people, unfortunately. I'd hope though, that a Berkeley student, who accepted admission into a school with a history of protest and trying to change things, would realize this, and wouldn't complain about being inconvenienced because people are standing up for what they believe in.

Also, its a bit disingenuous to argue that the protestors are simply trying to ""annoy people.""

>Taking up police officers' time and resources when they could be doing far more important things?

If it's not worth their time, then they can let the students stay. But it's not a license to use unreasonable force. That's like saying they can search your house without a warrant because they have better things to do than file the paperwork.
One man is in the hospital. You tell me.
I was debating this

>This is creating a victim where there is no victim. No one was inconvenienced or adversely affected by the protest except the protesters themselves, who were beaten.

and you said this

>Protests are never pretty, civil unrest is never fun and happy and trying to change things is always going to 'inconvenience' people, unfortunately. I'd hope though, that a Berkeley student, who accepted admission into a school with a history of protest and trying to change things, would realize this, and wouldn't complain about being inconvenienced because people are standing up for what they believe in.


I think you can see why I might be annoyed that people are making terrible arguments. ""We didn't inconvenience anybody!"" ""... yes you did"" ""Well of course we did, just deal with it and stop complaining""

> Also, its a bit disingenuous to argue that the protestors are simply trying to ""annoy people.""

It's a bit disingenuous to argue that they are not trying to annoy people. By any definition of the word, that is what they are trying to do. If it were less than annoying, then nobody would pay attention at all. If it were more than annoying, it would be making a difference directly or else being violent / destructive. Right now it is a bunch of people gathering in one place, disregarding rules, and generally being loud and disobedient. Come up with another word for ""annoy"" if you want, but that seems to be a good word to describe their purpose.
It's not like saying that at all, because searching a house without a warrant is illegal, and using force in the case of obstruction of justice is not illegal.
How is he doing? I hope no one was seriously injured.

Also, I tell you what?
I'm not sure you know what 'definition' means. By the very *definition* of the words 'protest' and 'annoy,' the two practices are very different. Arguing that the main goal of the protests is simply to ""irritate or harass"" people is disingenuous in that the purpose of a protest is ""a formal declaration of disapproval or objection issued by a concerned person, group, or organization.""

I'm not sure if you realize you're undermining any legitimacy of the protests by claiming they are only trying to irritate people, and ruling out the possibility that they are actually expressing dissatisfaction or attempting to change things, but that's exactly what you're doing.

Unreasonable force is illegal.
I stand by what I said. Would you not agree that a pretty well accepted colloquial and connotative definition of ""annoy"" would include irritating or harassing others in order to gain attention. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to do, not at all. In fact it is often very necessary to annoy in order to make things happen. ""Annoy"" is not the enemy of change. It is not the enemy of expression of dissatisfaction. It's a word with a meaning, that I used because people use fucking words to describe things and I thought it might be more efficient to use the word ""annoy"" instead of say ""would like to express dissatisfaction in the attempt to garner attention and thus change things from the way they are."" The difference is almost entirely rhetorical and I'm sick of defending myself from your completely unsubstantiated claims of my intent to undermine the protest. YOU might not use the word ""annoy"" because you think that rhetorical fluff adds to the legitimacy of the protest, but I really don't give a shit.

I'm not sure you realize you're undermining the legitimacy of my word choice by claiming that it is only trying to undermine the legitimacy of the protests, ruling out the possibility that I was only trying to express my thoughts efficiently and that the word ""annoy"" actually describes what a protest is trying to do very succinctly, but that's exactly what you're doing.
A quick google search and some reference checking revealed this:
http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/continuum.htm

Based on this model (although it gives me the impression that it might change based on the police department or the local county or state government or something), the police at Occupy Cal skipped the ""Empty-Hand control"" step, unless I missed something from the protests, going straight to blunt impact. 

There were other models I also found, such as the circular one here
http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Aveni/The%20Force%20Continuum%20Conundrum.pdf
which might suggest that impact weapons could be appropriate in the case of active resistance (I think the word ""violent"" is not applicable to the protesters, but ""active resistance"" appears to be a much more apt descriptor)

I'm not sure what the Alameda police department policies are / if there are policies specific to Alameda County. I don't think this is a cut and dried case of excessive force, though. Does anybody know what happened to the guy at the hospital?
I would agree, in fact, that's the actual definition. But to argue that their sole purpose is simply to annoy people quite literally implies they don't have any other goals. To argue that one of their main *means* of protesting is by gaining attention through the use of 'irritating' (which I would argue is a subjective assessment) is quite different, and I think we should make the distinction.

I'm just not sure what your point is about protests. Sure, they can and do irritate people for whatever reason. But if you support their right to exist, I'm not sure what there is to be done about it. 

Btw, I wasn't claiming you wanted to ban all protests, as is evident by the fact that I put a ? at the end of my statement, I was just following the line of logic that I was reading from your comments and offered a ludicrous suggestion to prove my point that there isn't really a solution other than 'get used to it' if someone doesn't a protest for whatever reason. 
Again, though, you are presuming me to have a higher point here because, as you say, you might follow my logic to go there, but that doesn't mean that's actually where I wanted to go. I think you are confusing the defense of my syntax as being a point. Above, I used the word ""annoy"" to describe what protests are doing, because I felt it was an appropriate word. That doesn't mean that the interpretation you draw from my use from that word defines my entire opinion on the protests and whether or not they should exist. That is a meaning that you are imposing upon me, when all I wanted to do was use a word and you disagreed with my word choice."
