Cs 61b + data 100 + R4b + Chinese 1a (mandarin)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/udghcx/cs_61b_data_100_r4b_chinese_1a_mandarin/,2022-04-27 16:04:34,"Doable? I’m an intended data science + cognitive science major, took cs 61a with eecs 16a and 2 breadths and thought it was rough. 

Side note, does anyone know what the workload is like for Chinese 1a or R4b with Michael Larkin (topic is something like tech and society)?","Definitely doable- but im kinda getting shafted by 61b right now.
From reading the RMP reviews, 1A should be a good learning experience and not overly difficult, although as a 5 unit class I’m sure you’ll spend a fair amount of time with practice and homework.  You’ll get tested though, and if you’re a heritage speaker chances are you’ll be moved into the 1AX class.  At least Chinese languages in the spoken form has the same subject-verb-object structure like English, which helps a lot."
