taking cs70 after math 55,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1beyr2p/taking_cs70_after_math_55/,2024-03-14 15:58:26,"hi,

I took math 55 last spring cuz I wanted to be an applied math major. I have since changed to CS (thanks olga holtz), so I am now taking cs 70. Will my grade in cs70 count towards my cumulative gpa? Or just my major gpa? How does this work. Thanks!
 ","afaik ur cs70 grade won't count towards ur cumulative gpa bc the school will consider ur math 55 grade for gpa but the cs department will use your cs70 grade into consideration when declaring you
What if I do better in cs 70?"
Best instructor for math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y9htuz/best_instructor_for_math_104/,2022-10-20 19:54:50,"Out of Krutika Tawri, Ryan Hass, Khalilah Beal-Uribe, Mengxuan Yang, Zhuhai Ding, Olga Holtz. Appreciate any comments on teaching styles and fairness of the exams. 
I heard a lot of good things about Hass. Very outstanding. Don't if I should choose him since other smart math majors would def choose him and the class is curved.","Hass is an all around great choice. As you seem familiar, I won't elaborate apart from noting that his 104 is on the easier side. What I can say is this: absolutely do *not* take Beal. Awful and apathetic.

Holtz is the only other option who is a regular faculty member. She's known to be quite tough, but definitely thorough and reasonable. If you want to take a deep dive into analysis, she's the best option.

All the rest are postdocs/visiting scholars who are brand new.
I have Krutika Tawri for 185 rn. The lectures are easy to understand and the pace is decent. Hws are long in terms of number of problems, but the difficulty is not hard. The midterm was also not too difficult. I would recommend taking 104 with them. Dunno about the others…
Bro hass all the wayyyy. Idk abt his being on the easier side cuz his exams are def challenging, but i can understand that his lectures and explaining concepts make understanding 104 possible. Honestly, just take Hass.
Hi! Haas's class already filled up for non-math majors :/. If I'm looking for a easier grade (because my GPA matters quite a bit to me), which one of the other professors would you recommend?

But she also j reads off the book? And sometimes she j skips proofs of important theorems. I do agree with the rest of ur comment tho. IMO she might be good at lecturing but she's not good at teaching.
Yang, Ding, and Tawri are all new postdocs, so I can't comment on their style/experience at all, sadly.
I am in the same boat as you. Where do you end up with?
Her 110 is considered challenging. You'll definitely experience linear algebra in its full force. But 110 is an amazing class, and Olga will give it the energy it deserves.
Yeah ur right. That’s def a fair criticism. What I wanna say is that, if someone else is a solid 10/10 choice, go w them. But, they make a solid backup, and as far as profs go, you can very easily do way way worse, or so has been my experience.

I believe she uses Axler, yes."
Which math professor would you recommmend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6cbeq/which_math_professor_would_you_recommmend/,2020-04-22 16:53:00,"I haven't taken any uppers for math yet but I'm hearing so many bad things about a lot of profs :k. The classes I'm thinking of are 104(taught by Ian L Charlesworth,Sebastian Eterovic,Koji Shimizu), 110(taught by Zvezdelina Stankova), 113(taught by Semen Artamonov), and 128A(Olga Holtz) Thanks in advance :)","Art for 113 is really good imo, sometimes his lectures and instruction are unclear, but he is a massive chiller and cares that you do well. Fair and all that, I have no exp with the other sorry
I took math 113 with Koji Shimizu and it went pretty well. He is very happy to interact with students and answer questions. I will warn though he does have an accent (I did not find it hard to understand but hey you do you).

I took math 110 with Zvezda and I have been traumatized. I would say the class content is fair but she tends to be rather intimidating. Some people really like her, some people still have nightmares about saying ""dobro utro."" She also has an accent but it is pretty mild (again, you do you). Learning about Bulgaria was cool I guess.

As for the difficulty of classes (from easiest to hardest based on my sad grades): Math 128A, Math 110, Math 104, Math 113.
Holtz I’ve heard is very good for 128A.
Aight, thanks a lot!
Wow is 128A easier than 110? I had not expected that since I always thought 128 is terrible
Got it thanks :)
oof sorry for slow reply. I don't think 128A is easier than 110. However, I did get a higher grade in 128A than math 110. I don't know how that happened but such is life. I took 128A later so perhaps my more developed skills helped.
I see, thanks a lot :))))"
Class not appearing on Schedule Planner,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6j2phk/class_not_appearing_on_schedule_planner/,2017-06-23 10:31:27,"I'm trying to sign up for Math 55 in the Schedule Planner but there is no option available, both for the class and teacher (Olga Holtz). I've attached a screenshot of what I see when trying to add the class. Is there something I'm missing or overlooking?

If it has any importance, I am a pre-stats major.

I think they're still having issues with discussion sections throughout the scheduling system. Don't mind it too much.
I think it might be that there are no open sections. I don't get get why there would still be open seats in that case though so I'm a bit confused. 
Is there any time you think it should be fixed by? I'm trying to set up the multi-year planner as soon as possible.
I tried contacting the math advisors but nothing yet"
Which is easier: CS70 or Math 55?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ep684e/which_is_easier_cs70_or_math_55/,2020-01-15 10:33:39,"I'm a Cogsci major and am not really a fan of math. I heard Math 55 is easier but I also read the teacher this semester is not the best.

Math 55 is with Olga V. Holtz and CS70 is with [Babak Ayazifar](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/ayazifar.html), [Doug Tygar](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/tygar.html).","Math 55 is known to be easier because they exclude various non discrete math topics covered in 70 like RSA, computability, etc
Don't know much about the instructors, but regardless of that, Math 55 will almost certainly be much easier. The class covers a smaller range of topics, in less detail. For comparison, people usually many hours (like 10+) on each week's homework for CS 70, where 55 is probably a few hours at most. Also, in CS 70 you'll be with a lot of intended CS majors who are very worried about meeting their GPA cap and so forth.

All that said, I should say that I found Math 55 to be pretty unfulfilling (and frankly a little boring) and probably would have rather taken 70. If you care about learning the material in significantly more depth, I would recommend that. But if you don't care much about math-y stuff and just want to fulfill your Cogsci pre-reqs, Math 55 will be the way to go.
Definitely 55. 70 covers a lot more material and goes much more in depth in a shorter amount of time (so we can spend the rest of the time for probability theory). Also the class has a lot of CS intended students who care about their GPA so the curve might be a bit tougher. I recall looking through math 55 homework and exams from my friend and seeing the difference in the level of difficulty from questions in 70.
Holtz is a great professor but is not going to be easy if you're not a fan of math.  I would say 55 will likely be more difficult than 70 this semester in terms of mathematical difficulty, based on my experience with Holtz's 55.  I'd probably recommend taking Math 55 in the Fall if you can wait a semester, because both classes probably will be relatively painful.  

I would take most of the advice you hear with a grain of salt because even if 55 is ""easier"" on average it also varies much more.  CS 70 is consistent in that it isn't usually taught very well from a mathematical pedagogy perspective.
I took 110 with Holtz and would guess Math 55 with Holtz will be similar in difficulty to CS70
No idea who you took 55 with but I did very well in Holtz's last time teaching 55 and easily spent more than 10 hours on the homeworks each week, they were very difficult usually.  But they were very fun and I learned a lot from them!
Classes are what you make of them. its quite possible you would have had to spend 1.5x the amount of time you did in math 55 than cs 70 to do well in the latter.
Maybe it's possible but I'm fairly certain it's not since Math 55 was also much more work than many of my math upper divs (for my level of mathematical maturity at the time of course) and Holtz's problem sets consistently had problems which were just objectively more difficult than those you'd find on a CS70 pset.  There were IMO level problems occasionally.  Maybe the grading was less harsh?  I don't know."
Sick of math 110,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11zptgp/sick_of_math_110/,2023-03-23 09:38:58,"our professor never responds to messages and i don't feel motivated at all in the class. i don't go to lectures anymore and I feel like our prof is a little fake. She comes off across as really open and u can ask anything, but doesn't really respond. Also who hosts office hours on Fridays and Saturday? No one respondsn on edstem and Canvas. It's super empty with unanswered questions that people just don't bother answering questions anymore. Just feeling really demotivated in this class and losing interest really fast and just wanted to rant","[deleted]
The last lecture I watched was the one she recorded. I don’t find lecture anymore helpful than the book itself because it’s hard to keep up with her lectures and take notes and she says not to take notes but I have a difficult time recalling things without notes. I would love to attend more but I just don’t see the benefit. I really wish she’d post her notes. Even if it’s just scratch work, it would be so helpful.
I get your frustration but you are only hurting yourself by not attending lectures. I say you try to connect with a pair and kindly explain to them what you don't get and see if they do understand it and can help you. Also, a teacher isn't obligated to answer anything after hours and i think she was just trying to be nice with a kind gesture. Anyway, wish you luck.
I say this definitely from my experiences but going to lecture is really important when it comes to upper div math. I admittedly don't know how your professor teaches but reading textbook or notes gets less helpful when a lot of time in lecture for upper div math is not for defining concepts but showing and proving properties about those concepts. Lecture, when done right, is not an opportunity for memorizing definitions but rather learning and practicing the thought processes that lead to those definitions.
What professor?
Holy crap same we literally didn’t have a syllabus until like 3 weeks ago. Everyone was super confused about the grading scheme lol… it’s crazy how you guys don’t have a syllabus yet tho… it’s basically more than halfway thru the semester…?
yeah she is quite interesting........
Hmmm that’s interesting. I’m not really sure what you mean by thought process tho? Like how they arrived at those theorems?
Olga holtz"
