French 43A w/Michael Arrigo,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/x01hnk/french_43a_wmichael_arrigo/,2022-08-28 10:52:41,Is anyone taking this class this semester? How is it?,"I’m not taking the course, so I do not have experience to share, but I saw the syllabus and it’s mandatory lecture attendance, canvas discussions, and daily reading. Exams are short answers + mini-essay."
FRENCH/SCANDIN R1B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rr1gel/frenchscandin_r1b/,2021-12-28 22:34:14,Has anyone ever taken French R1B with Michael Arrigo or Scandin R5B with Rue Taylor? Trying to figure out which R1B is going to be easier.,"Generally the R5s tend to be easier grade wise than R1s
Rue Taylor is an awesome Professor. I had rue for r1a Scandin and really enjoyed the class. Pretty easy grading as well as long as you do the work.
just curious but hasn't enrollment for phase 2 already started? do transfer students enroll next week or something like that?"
