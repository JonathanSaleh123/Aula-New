Is discussion Attendance Mandatory?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/109koem/is_discussion_attendance_mandatory/,2023-01-11 16:16:29,hey yall. I am taking physics 89 with professor Ori Ganor and Physics 5a with professor Andrew Charman this spring semester. Do you know if discussion attendance is mandatory for them? I am going to have time conflicts with discussions during the first 3 ish weeks of class.,"Yes
Donâ€™t take lower Division physics courses
Got it, thank you for the reply. If you don't mind me asking, for which class is discussion attendance mandatory, physics 89 or physics 5a?"
"Physics 110A, 112, 105",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bqc69p/physics_110a_112_105/,2019-05-18 19:56:45,"I'm taking Physics 105 with Edgar Knobloch, Physics 112 with William Holzapfel, and Physics 110A with Ori Ganor next Fall. Does anyone have a syllabus from any of these classes for these instructors? I checked Tau Beta Pi's Exams and Syllabi archive, but I could only find Holzapfel's Fall 2017 Physics 112 syllabus. I want to start studying over the Summer. Also, for those of you who took a class with any of these professors, did you enjoy the class? Thanks in advanced!","Reading the textbook or just learning about the topics in the class is a good idea, you don't necessarily need the syllabus. I think Griffth's Electrodynamics is common for E&M, and we used Taylor Analytic Mechanics for 105. But honestly, learning the physics concepts will help you, and there are plenty of topics which are pretty much guaranteed to show up.
I was just planning to get the books that those professors intend on using ahead of time. I already have Griffiths E&M .... I'll look into getting the pdf or borrowing a hardcopy of Taylor from the library. Thanks :)
I am probably also taking 110A with Ganor next semester, so I might see you there.
Hopefully, I'll see you there :)"
