Help @anyone who's taken psych courses!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hrvsbx/help_anyone_whos_taken_psych_courses/,2020-07-15 13:48:43,"Has anyone had Ryan Lundell-Creagh as a GSI before? He's the professor for psych 2 this year and I wasn't sure why I couldn't find info on him on Rate my Professor until I realized he was still a grad student recently. If anyone has any info on how he is/his grading, I'd appreciate it!","I took PSYCH N150 with Prof John and Ryan was the GSI. Ryan graded fairly and as long ad you put effort in FRQ assignments, you'll get full credit. He was also really nice and helpful, which is not a surprise since he's Canadian. Lol
Hi!! If you have his email is there any way you’d mind forwarding it to me??? The waitlist is full -capped at 4- and I’m trying to see if he’ll let me in the class by chance :(
Haha gotta love Canadians:) So would you say it's fairly easy to get an A with him then? Sorry I have some other classes this semester that are pretty brutal so I'm really trying to avoid profs that are harsh graders and/or give tons of work
It was easy to get an A, but don't expect the workload to be light. There was a lot of things to so (surveys, questions, etc.) and some of them were time consuming but not hard at all. Not sure about your class, but PSYCH N150 is an upper division class.
Mine is Psych 2 so prob not as bad since it's lower division. But thank you so so much for the advice!"
