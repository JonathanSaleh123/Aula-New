Should I try to take CS 189 Spring Semester freshman year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c53psv/should_i_try_to_take_cs_189_spring_semester/,2024-04-15 18:28:27,"I'm going to be entering Cal this fall as an EECS major. Since CS 189 is important for getting roles in ML labs at Berkeley and a prereq for a lot of other ML classes (CS 182, CS 285, CS 280) that I'd like to take at some point, I'd like to take it as soon as reasonably possible. I've heard it's easier in the Spring Semester, so I'm considering trying to take it either Freshman or Sophomore spring semester. Ideally, I'd like to take it Freshman Spring because I'd want to be able to start doing some research and/or ML internships sophomore year. However, I know this would probably be a pain since most people say CS189 is crazy hard.

If I wanted to do this, what courses should I take fall semester before taking CS189? On Berkeleytime it lists Math 53, Math 54, and CS 70 as the prereqs, but I've also heard that Berkeley doesn't really enforce prereqs too much and that people have taken CS189 without all 3 of these, and that it's more important to know the general concepts (which you can sometimes pick up from other classes). I've considered just doing Math 53, Math 54, and CS 70 my first semester, but that seems like a very weird first semester lineup and I'd guess that it'd be better to do some of the other lower div CS courses like 61A.

For context, I got a 5 on the Calc BC exam (so should be able to skip Math 1AB) and I have experience with ML from HS. I did Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera (I don't think it exists anymore tho cause he just has a ML Specialization there now) and Ng's Deep Learning Specialization (technically I didn't finish the last 1/3 of course 5 because school, but I watched the videos and I feel comfortable with those topics), and I've also done projects/ECs/internships doing ML stuff with TF, Torch, and JAX. My junior year CS course also covered ML, but it was mostly the basics. I don't know how well most of this would translate to CS 189 though (and to be clear, I'm not expecting to do well in the class just because I have some past ML experience, I'm expecting it to be incredibly hard based on what everyone else has said and that it probably uses more advanced math than I currently know). I also have English AP credit (5 on AP Lang) so I'm pretty sure I can just skip R&C A and do R&C B next year (don't need to worry about fitting in R&C A this year, at least I think so). I'm also trying to graduate in 3 years and do a 3+1 master's (mainly to start working earlier, and also to save money cause OOS is murder), which is part of the reason why I'm trynna do CS 189 so early (I want to start doing research early so I'll be set up well to apply for the masters). I could end up just doing the normal 4 years, but I'm planning for 3 years because if I can graduate in 3 years then great, but if it ends up being too much I can just drop a few courses and graduate in 4 years (at least that's how I'm thinking about it). 

Do you think I should work towards taking CS 189 spring 2025, or should I wait to do it later? If you think it would be doable to do CS 189 in spring 2025, what courses would you recommend for my fall semester?

If there's also anything else I'm forgetting to consider (other requirements and what not) please let me know, I've only just started planning everything out so I'm bound it miss something.

PS: I'm pretty jet-lagged rn so sorry if this sounds like it was written by a crazy person who skins live chimpanzees","Yeah do it lol it’ll really help everyone else’s curve /s

Maybe take a CS class at Berkeley before making such plans lmao
I don't think you will be able to enroll CS189 in freshman. There is probably a long waitlist
I think 189 isn’t super important in order to do ML work, if you have done ML projects before u should be able to get a role in some ML lab with some basic networking. I joined a lab first semester just by reaching out to grad students, they are happy to help if you have experience with projects
Yeah it would be a breeze, make sure to take it with 162 and 170
Doesn’t hurt to try, you can always drop if it’s too much, and dropping it Freshman year is chill cause you can always try again
If you're not regents or DSP or at least a junior your odds of enrolling are slim, classes full up really fast especially desirable ones. 

That said if you can enroll sure go for it.
Before the high demand policy it used to work like this:

Summer: 61A + 70, then Fall: 61B + eecs126 + math 54, then Spring: eecs 127 + cs189 + math 110  
Then your sophmore year you can take stat210a/b stat c205a/b cs285, cs182, cs288, cs c281a/b
The course materials are public, so I recommend going through the lecture notes and homeworks over the summer: [189sp23](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s23/) [189sp24](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s24/). If you feel comfortable with the material, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't take it as soon as possible.

You can find any course webpages [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes-eecs.html) (in case you also wanted to look ahead at cs61a or cs70).
I doubt that you can’t even get in as a non senior
How is your linear algebra and probability skills? Honestly just google cs189, click hw2 and see if you can complete it, should be the best indicator if you’re ready for the class or not
You should first learn about how registration works at Berkeley before venturing into this.  

Spring CS 189 with our esteemed and now famous Professor Shewchuk is one of the most in-demand classes on campus, and unless you have priority registration, you won’t get in as a freshman.  Possibly not as a sophomore either.
bros actually cracked af
I’m definitely planning on cold emailing some profs (heard Abbeel and Levine take a lot of undergrads) and grad students.
I don’t know, wouldn’t that be a kind of light semester? I wanna have easy coursework but I still want a little bit of challenge. /s
Would I need to have done the pre reqs to be able to do that? And if I want to get a feel for the class, would you recommend just auditing it fall semester?
How can you take courses over the summer before your freshman year starts? I didn’t know that was a thing
wtf I know someone who had pretty much the exact schedule like this
Lin Alg experience isn’t great, I’d probably need to take a Lin alg class fall semester or do the khan academy lin alg course
Would you recommend just doing it in fall sophomore year then (assuming the fall one is less in demand)?
lmao abbeel wants tons of A+’s in classes
It might have change, but usually you don't need the pre reqs. I think auditing it in the Fall doesn't hurt. Really just depends how much time you have.
freshman edge/summer bridge. should be able to opt in to either of those programs through calcentral
It's just a small circle here at berkeley.
Make sure when you take linear you dont just learn how to do it but also learn the intuition behind it. Suggest u watch 3blue1brown videos before you take linear so when you do take it, it makes more sense.
Only if you’re cracked in probability and linear algebra. And throw in MVC too I suppose.
Thank you, I’ll probably try that then."
"Shit Cal Students Say: The backlash to Andrew Kooker's insensitive comments - oh wait, actually he was right all along and how dare Student Action drop him for expressing his brave and correct viewpoints?!?!",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rlbjj/shit_cal_students_say_the_backlash_to_andrew/,2012-03-30 12:09:22,"A couple days ago a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rh994/student_action_candidate_andrew_kooker_dropped/) was submitted to this subreddit linking to a Daily Cal article about Student Action's decision to drop Andrew Kooker from their Senate slate in response to some [some](http://i.imgur.com/RnBc2.jpg) [insensitive](http://i.imgur.com/a2Yel.png) [comments](http://i.imgur.com/CDv7k.jpg) claiming that non-engineering/hard science/business majors are wasting their time, money, and effort by going to Cal and majoring in things that will be useless to them post-graduation, among other things (shout-out to CNR, what what).

Given the response on Reddit was mostly agreeing that Andrew Kooker was indeed in the wrong, I expected the comments on the Daily Cal article to be similar in spirit...

NOPE!

So yeah... I'm just really upset after reading all these comments to be an Engineering major at what I thought was a great school with a great community.","The Daily Cal comments section is not an accurate representation of the Cal community.  I bet most people on campus have no idea who Andrew Kooker is, or care what he has to say.
I'm confused, didn't he resign? What's all this about protecting free speech?
who?
There will always be a very overvocal minority waiting to get butthurt over anything.
I place ""taking a huge shit"" higher than ""Daily Cal comments"" on my ""Things I Deem Appropriate for Conversation with People"" list.

You would do well to take a similar approach.
I always feel that some ""liberal"" outlets like the Daily Cal or some SF news sites, the comment section attracts some very conservative or trolly crowds. 
In which [/r/berkeley](/r/berkeley) is introduced to the [effort post]. I like it, but I'd let SRS keep the poop-speak.
The Daily Cal comments section is where trolls come out to play, just roll your eyes and move on.
People who foolishly think their degree is useless really need to stop feeling sorry for themselves and do something to change their ""fate"". 
You thought UCB had a great community? What are you a freshmen? It sounds to me like Kooker is just representing the exact views of the the university administration and what they've been for years. Honestly, I'm surprised there even still are any liberal arts at Cal. 
The Daily Cal comment section is full of trolls, much like any other comment section of a newspaper (check out CNN or Fox's comment section and you'll see the same thing).  
would you say thats a good or bad thing?
Student Action took him off the slate but is keeping him around because he ""shows promise"".  He'll be back at some point in the future.
care to explain?
I wouldn't say it's good or bad.  I don't think what he did hurt anyone but himself.
It's good in the sense that his screw-ups don't cost him as much now as they will when/if he becomes a career politician.  It's fairly painless for him to discover now that it's best to keep your contempt for the people who elect you to yourself.
But he was the one who resigned, right?
Engineering departments haven't had their budgets cut as much, I don't think. (this is vaguely remembered from a Daily Cal editorial a few years ago)

I'm guessing that's what he's talking about.
Dunno, I just remember seeing something about SA issuing a statement about him being off the ticket but still in the party.  I'm not at Cal anymore, so I don't keep up with these things so much.
Yeah, I'm not sure how true that is.  I know they had to combine two of the ChemE lab classes into one a few years to save money (I was actually the last class that had the opportunity to take both, which was worth it because those classes are probably the most informative ones).  I was under the impression that budget cuts have affected every department pretty equally.  It might be that more money goes to engineering because the costs are higher.
I don't think many of us here even do"
Looking into MS/Post Bacc IN CS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/brv3pt/looking_into_mspost_bacc_in_cs/,2019-05-22 15:19:30,"&#x200B;

Hi All,

So I recently graduated in August 2018 from UC Berkeley

My Major was in Cognitive Science with a 2.912 GPA.

Coding Classes I took

CS10 - The Beauty and Joy of Computing - SNAP/ 10% Python - Learned Recursion, If Else, Functionality of programming

CS61A - The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (C+) - Python

CS61B - Data Structures (D+) - Java

Cog Sci 131 - Computational Models of Cognition (B)- Learned PCA Algorithm/K-Means - in Python

At a California Community College

COMSC 2 Assembly Language for x86 Processors (B+)

MOOCS

CS50 Harvard on EDX - Learned C - Introduction to Computer Science,

Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng - in MATLAB

Work Experience:

6 MONTHS in Non-Coding Database Monitoring Job

&#x200B;

I wanted ask which way is the best route for me to get a Software Engineering Job? I am focusing on getting an Post Bacc/MS in Computer Science so I also wanted to find out which programs I should apply to? I could not do CS at Berkeley but not giving up on it. Would Bachelors or Masters be better for me?","In your situation I would probably try for a masters instead, but really you should be able to get a SWE job without either.
You don’t need more education; you need to grind prep materials for interviews and coding screens."

Also adding Professor Karl Hedrick (ME 132) and Professor David Dornfeld (ME 290I).

It is a sinking feeling to say the least that whoever taught you something is no longer with us.
Packard was amazing. Took him for E7 as well as ME132 and he was easily one of my best professors. Great human as well.

Next to passing on what they taught you to others, living on in your memory and appreciation is about the best they (or any of us) could hope for.  But yes, it's wonderful to appreciate them while they are still around to say ""hey"" too.
Had him in a freshman seminar a year before he passed. He was awesome. Even though I kept falling asleep in class because my sleep schedule was fucked up. He was super nice and always tried his best to make class fun and interesting. RIP

I'd like to draw a connection to elementary/middle/high schools in my neighborhood: some of them are known to be ""good schools"" because of high test scores or whatnot. So does that mean they are better at teaching? Are the teachers better there? Or is it just that these ""good schools"" are in better parts of town and so the students who attend these schools are more privileged and have the resources to focus on their education?

When you have a bunch of top people in a school, naturally it's better. Naturally, great achievements happen at that school. Naturally, more people want to apply because they hear about the school's achievements. Naturally, more professors want to apply. Naturally, the school only lets the top professors in. Naturally, those top students graduate and as a whole make more money. Naturally, those top-notch alumni can donate more money back to the school. Naturally, the school has more money to fund its amazing students and professors. Naturally, it's a ""great school"".

And then when other universities pop up, naturally, prospective students are skeptical of them until they're established, and so prospective students naturally apply to established universities before they consider the newly created institutions. Naturally, this more established university has a lower admittance rate than newer universities. Naturally, a lower admittance rate gives off the vibe it's a better place, and naturally the university can only admit the top applicants who achieve more, on average, than students at less selective universities. And there, we're in that cycle.

> Key realization: When ""top"" universities go around the county encouraging students to apply, it's not because they need to get their name out and convince students that they are good universities. They are already well known. Everyone already knows they're Ivy league or whatever. I believe it's mainly to get more people to apply so they can boast lower admittance rates. Because, come on now, you can't tell me you haven't looked at the admittance rate of a school to see ""how good"" it is.

So Cal and many of the Ivy Leagues and UCLA, Stanford, and CalTech are also said to have good CS programs -- and they all have low admission rates. It seems that almost every school that has a ""good CS program"" has a low admission rate. No? So for the most part, I'd say that schools with a ""good CS program"" admit only the top students.

Not all rankings are meaningless, and even the most questionable ranking system probably has some truth in it. Its not logical to just dismiss these rankings because its unclear exactly how they measure a school's quality. I'm also curious why you think these notions are ""baseless"" and ""evidence-less.""

If you look at US news's rankings today you see that princeton is in first place and harvard is in second place. Are you convinced princeton is a better school than harvard? If you go to harvard will you think that you're not getting the best <any of the qualities that make a good school, good> as you would have received at princeton?
How about if you go to the 3rd place school?...honestly, would you feel that had you gotten into a school higher on the list, then you'd have gone to a ""better"" university? Can you honestly say that your education would have been better if you had gone to a ""better"" school?

> I don't buy it. I don't see any truth in princeton being better than harvard or being better than Cal. It's just another school. And after all, we're each in only one or two or three majors. These rankings are for the school as a whole. I wouldn't trust them to tell me anything about the quality of my education.

> 
> So if I got into the #1 university I'll get a better CS education than if I had gone to #5 or #7 on the list? Really? I don't buy it. That's why I believe their rankings can be dismissed. Now of course, you wouldn't go to some random college that opened up a year ago and expect them to have their CS program be as well run as in schools that have been in the business for like 40+ years. But randomly pick any school that you hear people talk about and it will be a fine school, if you personally like it.

> Basically, go to any university that you personally like and it will be fine. As long as you like the school, you can't go wrong by going to get a CS degree at, for example, UCSD instead of Stanford or CalTech or Berkeley. At the end of the day it comes down to what you do with the educational opportunities that are given to you.

Furthermore, there are even even schools that you know of that suck in some of the metrics and they are still considered a  top school. Like Cal has bad CS class sizes and yet, we're fine here because we make it work. And guess what, it's still a top school in their rankings. 
> 
> Here's another way to see it. I think it's a bit like picking a country to live in (assuming you know the language and culture of any country you choose). Is living in the US better or worse than living in Canada or the UK? Is living in France better or worse than living in Switzerland? I mean, clearly living in the US is better than living in some poor country in the middle of a war, but if someone came out with rankings about which countries are the best to live in, would you believe their rankings? I wouldn't. If they tell me italy is two places ahead of germany or that Japan is 5 places worse than Australia I wouldn't believe them because they don't know enough. They can quantify rankings based on their own preferences but they can't tell me where is the best place for me to live . They're all good enough countries! The best country for me to live in depends on my own preferences. And on top of that, it really depends where I live in said country, and how I live, and so many other factors.

> OP, I think you are trying to extract too much from these rankings. I completely agree with you that comparing schools based on single-digit ranking difference is a subjective matter, and people should perform their own research to figure out what they want from a school. However, the fact that no ranking system can these subjective opinions is not be a reason to disregard the rankings completely. They do their best to capture the differences between schools.

A student replied:

> There is some good discussion going on here, especially with regards to how much we should regard rankings. I think a high ranking (in a particular subject) is more indicative of the faculty quality. Indirectly, this attracts top students, and hence, after years of this process, sometimes some people want to go to a particular school because of who they might be surrounded by (this includes other students, not just instructors). Along the lines, this gets blurred as an outright reason to attend the school, when it probably shouldn't; because, as stated above, going to a higher ranking school does not therefore mean you are learning CS ""better"". Being in a better ""environment"" however, thats kind of subjective, and entirely is based on what someone deems ""better"".
> 
> I picked Cal EECS over schools some people may not have (a couple ivies included; not bragging just making a point). Whereas someone else might have gone to the highest possible ranked undergraduate university they were accepted to. Are my reasons better? I don't know, I don't think so. So to the OP's point about what makes a school better, I think these things are indeed subjective and it may not be possible to extract a host of useful information. Not because they are doing an inadequate job at making the rankings, rather, some people just care about different things when it comes to picking a school. The rankings may ""try"" to capture that, but as most people may agree, its still incomplete.

I suppose I take issue with the fact that yes, the rankings are opinions that could be plain wrong and yet, I think, ever since they've started coming out annually, it's been an obsessive race to get into the top universities. People take them to heart too seriously. So in a sense, the fact that people take them so seriously, makes me want to hold them up to a high standard. But, at the end of the day, they are indeed just opinions of some people working at a news outlet. They never promised to be accurate. I should chill.
> 
> 2. There are over 2000 accredited universities in the U.S. so 27th position isn't bad at all. Though idk which rankings you're looking at because the us news one I'm looking at puts its at 30th. But w/e it's somewhere in the 20s-30s.
> 
> 3. You mentioned ""access to faculty"". How can such a thing be measured? It's so...unscientific, and that makes me highly skeptical of rankings. Also, I should have been more specific and should have said ""I wouldn't trust them to tell me anything about the quality of my education in my major"".
> 
> 4. UCSD is known (for some reason) to be a good CS school, but it's not known (for some reason) to be as good as Cal, MIT, Stanford so I used it as an example of a school that's not revered as the best out there but is still great (as far as its reputation goes).
> 
> 5. The schools that you hear commonly about (living in CA) aren't all ranked highest. UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara aren't regarded super highly in rankings but you hear about them a lot. I'm sure they have decent grad and retention rates. Nitpicking who has a few percent higher here or there doesn't matter. They're all great. Seriously, if your school makes it to the us news rankings, how worse can it possibly be compared to the top 30 in the rankings? Also, UT austin is 56 in the rankings and you see it as highly ranked--so yeah, whatever. the 56th position is also great. And so is 57th and 58th and so on. I really think if a school is known enough to be in the top 100 it's good. As long as enough people (students, faculty, and administrators) apply to be part of learning, teaching, and managing the school, it will be a good place b/c the school will be able to pick the best people out of those who apply. And the cycle of greatness kicks off from there.

> 6. teacher-student ratio is actually one of the metrics they use to rate schools. What I'm saying is that we have a bad ratio in 61A and other classes and yet we're totally fine academically. And, we're still getting good rankings despite that. Personally, I don't care too much about teacher-student ratio because that's the average of the school and vary greatly between different classes.

Even more broadly, how do we know even MIT, Stanford, and Cal have good CS programs? What is it about them that make them good?


Well that got philosophical hella fast.
Research and innovation of the professors.

Has very little to do with the undergraduates or the education they receive.
