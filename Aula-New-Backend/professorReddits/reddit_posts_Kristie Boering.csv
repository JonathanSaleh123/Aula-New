"Trying to avoid Kristie Boering for Chem 1A, do you think it's going to be a different professor for Spring?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w4acl0/trying_to_avoid_kristie_boering_for_chem_1a_do/,2022-07-21 00:27:49,,"yeah last year it was Alexis and she was great!
Yes
Oh shit is Boering really that bad…
I second this; she was a great professor for chem 1A!"
"Of the 132 faculty members who signed a letter advocating a boycott of classes and campus activities during the upcoming ""Free Speech Week"", only five professors are from STEM departments. Kristie Boering said her class, Chem 1A, will continue as planned. ""I have a job to do,"" Boering said.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/17/stem-professors-will-conduct-class-free-speech-week-despite-faculty-boycott/,2017-09-17 22:21:10,,"Most nerds remain disengaged from politics.

Hell, I was the same when the walkouts were happening while I was a student. 

All of my teachers had class. Hell, we had CS70 outside on the walls of Evans in the rain after somebody pulled the fire alarm during lecture. 

My memory is a little hazy, but Babak either cancelled class or spent the whole lecture talking about the reasons for the walkout though.
There is a LOT of material to get through in most STEM classes, barely enough time as it is, and the rest of the year depends on understanding the early core material.  Many EECS classes are on the other side of campus.  
The alt-right trolls intend to disrupt the university. Sometimes the way to win is not to play the game.
There is still hope for this campus. 

Also, is there an accurate count of actual faculty members who have signed this petition - not including GSIs?
If you have a bunch of racists on campus for an event, that inherently makes the campus less safe for those of us who aren't white, people will get harassed and potentially attacked. Same logic applies for women and LGBTQ people. I'm sure some faculty members are doing this to protect themselves, and others to not expose students to risk. 

The thing with STEM classes is that attendance is generally not mandatory, so if the professor is OK with coming and some students are not, that often isn't too big of a problem. Also, the many of the kind of people in these fields try to avoid politics (and many of them are the in demographics for whom that is possible). 
Sounds like by willingly disrupting our own education and replacing it with screaming and shouting we're giving the trolls exactly the results they want but ok
Good for her! These kids are trying to leverage free speech into a week off of school. I'm not surprised they'd be so upset when they get a taste of real life straight from someone who has actually accomplished things in her life...
By refusing to boycott classes during freeze peach week, they are showing themselves to be Nazi supporters.
Why is it less safe at Berk when the Right speaks but we hear nary a whisper when the Left riots? The violence seems to come from AntiFa towards anyone who self-describes as Right-wing. I may be out of the loop here, and if I'm speaking outside my lane then by all means please correct me, but how is having Conservatives speaking their opinions--which is their God given right--now considered *dangerous?* Are the folks at Berk suffering from some sort of sensitive eardrum syndrome? Easily given to the powers of persuasion? Help me out here. I'm struggling on this one.
>“I have a job to do,” Boering said.

>She also stated that if students feel unsafe, they will not be penalized for their absence. Boering said students can instead participate online but that she will still physically conduct her class, unless otherwise directed by campus administration.

Sounds like she's not against students ""taking a week off"" as you put it. 
>upset

lol you're so clueless, maybe you wouldn't be if you actually went here and knew that nobody's upset (or really gives a shit tbh)
really?
You must have never gone to logic class 
I have also unilaterally declared tomorrow to be anti-Hitler day. Anyone who shows up to campus will be declared literally Hitler. Please ask your professors to dump one class worth of material in order to accommodate my decree.
this is a low effort troll
I think you're misunderstanding me. My issue isn't with conservatives speaking their opinions, I don't think any of what I'm saying would've applied to the Ben Shapiro event previously. What's happening here is that at the request of a small group of Berkeley students a panel of speakers is coming to campus to basically discuss racist propaganda. It may be their ""god given' right to speak their opinion but they don't have  such a right to use Berkeley's campus as a space to do so, so I disagree with the Berkeley administration's approval of their attendance next week, as some of the content of the discussions is going to violate hate speech laws.

That being said ultimately it's not them getting a chance to speak that concerns me, it's that a lot of people in the community who harbor these kind of views will come out in force to attend. If you have a bunch of people who hate e.g. Muslims, that's the theme of one of the days) at an event about hating Muslims, it's pretty likely that Muslims are going to be harassed. This is pretty dangerous. See Charlottesville, see 1930s Germany, see a lot of things. 


I don't think this has anything to do with Antifa, whether they start anything or not, this will probably get violent. Also idk about this whole ""nary a whisper"" thing, they've been getting a lot of criticism.
