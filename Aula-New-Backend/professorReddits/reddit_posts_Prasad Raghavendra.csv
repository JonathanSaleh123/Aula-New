How is CS170 with Christian Borgs and Prasad Raghavendra?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17hs0kb/how_is_cs170_with_christian_borgs_and_prasad/,2023-10-27 09:54:42,How is CS170 with Christian Borgs and Prasad Raghavendra?,I liked Raghavendra. Didn’t have Borgs
Cs 188 + EECS 127 + (Math 104 or CS 170)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yncxsq/cs_188_eecs_127_math_104_or_cs_170/,2022-11-05 18:27:09,"I'm definitely taking 188 and 127, which class would you guys recommend I take: math 104 or cs 170?

104 isn't my first upper div, but ik it's infamous for being more difficult than the other ones. I'm not planning to take any other class (except a decal) other than these so that in mind, how bad is the workload?

Also has anyone taken 170 with prof. Prasad Raghavendra recently? ratemyprof didn't have any recent reviews.

Thank you!","[deleted]
I'd probably go with 188+127+170. While 104 is an important class for building one's math foundations, it is neither strictly nor immediately necessary.
Cool, thank you! Also among the three, how's the workload for each class compared to say Data 140 or 61B?
How doable is CS 170 if the only stuff I remember from CS 70 are basic proof writing techniques such as contradiction, contraposition, induction…etc? I don’t remember much about graph theory and modular arithmetic, and definitely not CRT and RSA. I’m planning to take it next semester with CS 186 and IEOR 172. I was planning to take EECS 127 initially but the class is full and the waitlist is long so it seems like I have no chance of getting in, and 170 is seemingly the only feasible option now.
Thank you!"
