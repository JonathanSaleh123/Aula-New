Political science 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18eqy8d/political_science_1/,2023-12-09 16:14:31,"Hey! I'm taking political science 1 next semester with Paul Pierson for my American institution requirement and was wondering whats the class workload like?? is there a specific textbook to read or is it just random readings on bcourses? I would like to prepare ahead for the class, so does anyone have recommendations/tips to get an A? Thank you!","if it’s anything like mine, he just goes off the same thing he does from the past semesters and also used Ashcroft’s slides. Personally, I never did any of the reading and got a B+ but could be different for everyone, work load wasn’t much but GSIs made you do forced participation
Thank you so much! are there any required books that you had to read or were the readings just random pdfs on bcourses?"
