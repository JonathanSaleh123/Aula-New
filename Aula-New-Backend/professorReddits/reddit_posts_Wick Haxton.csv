Physics 137a Crommie vs Haxton,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mzz5bw/physics_137a_crommie_vs_haxton/,2021-04-27 14:30:04,"I am currently in 5c but really haven't been doing too well in it, so I'm basically going in blind to 137a. Should I choose to take the class with Michael Crommie or Wick Haxton? Haxton doesn't have any ratings on ratemyprofessor so idk anything about him.","Crommie is awesome.
I can’t choose either. I’m more interested in Haxton’s field of research but Crommie is supposedly a great teacher so idk."
"Is this schedule doable? Should I drop a class? If should, do I drop a tech class or a breadth class?",https://i.redd.it/rbw8c256mobc1.jpeg,2024-01-10 13:36:21,Thanks for answering. XD,"Why is your Friday afternoon open? You should be able to fit at least another 2-3 classes there 🤔
If you’re good at physics, drop a breadth. Else drop a tech
That’s so extensive man. Regardless how smart you are, you should spent some number of hours some day for each class( worksheets, slide reviews, assignments, online quizzes, practice questions…). There’s no way you can handle this.
Phew, that seems pretty intense even if I consider you wouldn't do any extracurricular activities.
Music can wait
To me it seems like with research and extracurriculars, this would be pretty hard, especially because doing this schedule would mean you have basically no time for other things and each class still requires a decent amount of work regardless of difficulty. I haven’t taken Physics yet but I’ve heard it can get pretty hard, so I would drop that if you’re not super comfortable with the material, but breadths could be easier to drop so that you could then do better in your techs.
Lol we are in two classes together but the rest of my classes are definitely easier.
This looks freaking hard. That being said, I love Matt Denham and swim PE! Hope that gets to stick around in your schedule!
As someone who did relatively well in 137A, I had to devote a lot of my time outside of class working to understand that material and get the homework done. I took the class with a good friend now pursuing a PhD in physics and I think it’s safe to say he also found it quite time consuming. Just accounting for the fact that it alone will likely take you 10 hours + a week outside of class I think you need to drop something, probably that class
Forgot to add, I’m also in a research. So I don’t know if I should drop one since the research requires 10hours a week
You gonna love Mendelssohn, he's such a sweetheart. Hw and grading are easy, his review/critic are critical and on point. Really goofy and love to get to know his students really well.
Bruh we are in same music class 😎
Drop 137A otherwise you dont have enough big blocks of time for research and studying
I don’t know much about music classes, but the physics is doable, especially with Chien-I (love that man). But the spread is AWFUL. Why is it so spread out? I like to crunch my schedules in the morning but I guess a downside is that I’m usually asleep in the second or third class 😴.
depends, how much adderall you got?
Should be alright
Assuming you don’t already know all the content of 5b and 5c, you should probably drop 5c and 137. They’re going to be very hard if you don’t understand all the prerequisites.

Also, doing fewer classes to do more research is probably always a good tradeoff. Really impress your research professor, try to get multiple papers out, be more valuable than a grad student.
Even if this schedule is “doable”, why would you do it? Do you not want to have fun this semester?
Dude i have ur WeChat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The problem is I don’t know if I’m good at physics
Which one? Music 27 or music 128
What r they?
In my own experience, I think it’s def doable (without research at least). I never did research in berk so I’m not quite sure how demanding it really is, but worst case scenario I would just drop a class. If it is all really demanding, maybe drop a tech, but if you think you are struggling mainly bcz of time spent on breadths, I would drop one. Hope this helps!
Yeah I heard about that but what I’m worried is the topic is about philosophy and I’m sure if I’m good at it.
Which one I have two music classes 🤔
I’ve taken 5a and 5b last semester, 5a was challenging but 5b was ok, so I think I would drop either 5c or 137a then
Make sense, ty
huh who r u?
Have you taken a physics course at Berkeley already?
137a and music 27.
tyty
I took music 128, honestly is very easy and during class is basically a discussion session to help to understand the topic, which should be fun. As long as you go to 90% of the lecture you should be fine!
Music 27. It’s my first music class, I don’t know what to expect 🫠
I forgot they had 5b and 5bl separated like that (they changed it since I graduated). In that case maybe it’s not crazy. I’d think that 5c should come before 137.
When u know u’ll know
Yeah I got one B+ and one A, that’s why idk if I’m good at it 😢

Maybe drop 137 then. Finish the lower divs and use your research exp to decide if you like / develop your physics skills. Horrible class time for 137 anyways
Why ppl r down voting this?
True
It’s a somewhat common meme on this subreddit for people to post absolutely ridiculous schedules (e.g. 40 units or something) and ask “iS tHiS scHeDuLe reAsoNabLe??” sarcastically.

I think most people looking at this post would knee jerk assume your post was referencing this meme because looking at your calendar spread alone, this looks like a pretty terrible schedule crunching from 9am-6/7pm every day (not to mention research).

Then I imagine people’d start scrolling down, reading your comments, and realizing that this isn’t a meme, and you’re being “genuine”. I’d put genuine in quotes because you mentioned you’ve gotten pretty good grades in your previous classes, which would probably make a lot of people think you’re posting here to humble brag about taking on a hard schedule (which is where that sarcastic meme comes from). With good grades like that, people might imagine you *should* have a reasonably good gauge of whether or not you’re good at physics and whether or not you can take on this kind of semester.

For what it’s worth, I don’t think there’s a way to avoid the downvotes on something like this even being genuine without both (a) being aware of the meme/sensitivity about these kinds of posts on this subreddit, and (b) putting up front in your post acknowledging that you already do pretty well but want advice anyway. Overall, I wouldn’t pay too much mind to the downvotes.

I don’t know physics, but I do agree with u/Away-Advance6823 on dropping 137, as from a high-level view, opening up your afternoon such that you’re not ending at 6/7pm every day should make things feel much better."
