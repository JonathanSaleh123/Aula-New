Stats 20 with Adam Lucas or Shobhana Murali Stoyanov?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6vmdi0/stats_20_with_adam_lucas_or_shobhana_murali/,2017-08-23 15:00:09,"Hi guys I'm deciding which professors to take at the minute. I'm an intended econ major and would really want to meet the gpa cutoff. Which of these two professors is better? Any advice to do well in the class is also greatly appreciated!

Many thanks in advance!","I took Stoyanov and I would advise against it if you have the option. Many people I know who took Lucas weren't to unhappy but I can safely say that he's better than Stoyanov. It's not that she's mean or whatever but I would say she is not a very good teacher. Stat 20 as a whole is basically reliant on if you have a good or bad GSI.
Took Lucas for another course. He's great at teaching and damn funny too. He's not as connected to GSIs as you might expect, so if you need support for the course admin stuff, contact him directly.
I've had both. Lucas is definitely better
Had lucas for 131a - pretty big fan of his style, funny as well
Thank you for the advice!
Thank you for the suggestion! So far I feel his lectures are very well paced.
Thank you for the feedback, was his test very tricky? Any tips on how to do well in his course? 
His tests aren't tricky. He's a really nice professor so just pay attention and you'll be fine"
Any tips for STAT 134 Final?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18bsnk5/any_tips_for_stat_134_final/,2023-12-05 17:44:59,"Hi, I'm taking stat 134 with Adam Lucas and I'm so worried about the final exam since the quizzes and midterms were extremely hard. Could anyone can give me tips about which topics should I focus on? I appreciate any advice! Thank you.","It’s hard to pinpoint which topics they will not focus on. Given the short amount of time left, do the practice exam and also all EC questions
Do all of the review materials, time yourself taking a practice final, redo midterm(s) and make sure you know how to do every problem on them.

As for taking the test itself, don’t leave anything blank. At least write down some of your thoughts and a few steps, even if you aren’t sure if it’s in the right direction. A blank response is easy to assign a zero to. Having something down, you can at least hope for partial credit. Pace yourself, and move on if you can’t solve a particular problem. You may find certain questions to be harder than others, and they’re usually in no particular order.

Know at least how to get started with each type of problem. It will benefit you to be able to identify what a certain type of problem is testing. Then, you can at the very least write down a few things you know about that topic and get some partial credit even if you don’t know how to fully solve the problem.

Know all of the distributions on the formula sheets and when they arise. You won’t have to memorize PDFs, but it can help to have a sense of what each looks like, so you can match distributions using their variable parts.

stat 134,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13d2ish/stat_134/,2023-05-09 11:56:51,SHAME ON U ADAM LUCAS,"![gif](giphy|R7weSSUjdPdoA)
I'm an incoming student planning to declare stats and these posts are scaring me 😭
Don’t worry. Recognize there’s bias in that one hears mostly just the extreme negatives/horror stories. Also this class is curved, which means that even doing poorly by other standards, you may do just fine or even well. Focus on yourself and your learning, embrace the challenge, and struggle through it together with your classmates. Also keep in mind that (almost) everyone finds the content hard/tricky too. In the end, you’ll be better for having risen to a challenge.

Bruv like all of our midterms and exams (except the take home) had the mean at ~50% total points. As long as you can fail successfully, you’re golden
This is reassuring to read, thank you! I've been feeling imposter syndrome a ton regarding my acceptance as a transfer recently and have been worried about being able to handle the academics here. It's definitely one of the most rewarding feelings to see your efforts pay off in the end for this kind of challenging coursework.
It honestly looks like a much more interesting and well-structured class, but the main problem is I'd have to take Data 8 first
You bet! Imposter syndrome is not uncommon here, so you are surely not alone in feeling that. Know that being admitted means you belong here. The academics will be difficult, but everyone feels it in some way or another. You may encounter people who seem to be naturally good at everything, but even they have their struggles. My advice is to embrace being around such amazing fellow students and treat it as an amazing opportunity to grow. Go bears!"
Thoughts on Stats 134,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13a3w83/thoughts_on_stats_134/,2023-05-06 15:13:20,"I'm planning to take stat 134 with Professor Adam Lucas in the Fall. Does anyone have thoughts on the course or the professor?

Also, how is this class without stats/prob experience? I've taken math 53 and 54, but no stats or data classes.","I’m not sure if you’re a stats major or DS major but I do feel really bad for the stats requirement because:

- Adam Lucas is fucking terrible holy cow
- If Data 140 is an option is terribly hard

Look him up on rate my professor and you’ll see the reviews, won’t recommend.
Lucas was fine lol, not a great professor obviously but dunno why he gets so much hate

That being said, Stat 134 in general is not that great of a class but as long as you just spam practice problems it is fine
Take the Stat 198 adjunct course through the SLC (Student Learning Center) when you take Stat 134. Helps a ton!
Stat 134 is bad and Lucas is bad. It’s actually gotten worse over the course of semesters.
i've only ever heard bad things about lucas, also 140 is apparently a much better structured class, textbook is written by the goated adhikari

but also apparently its good to get some stats/probability exp before 140, either through data 88s or stat 20
1. tbh adam is not as bad as people say; a little dry but not horrible.

2. if you sign up for it, go to the slc a lot. there will be an adjunct this fall and you should join it.

3. hard as shit course that eats up most of my time but it is doable imo.
Terrible class that was hard as hell. As someone said above TAKE THE ADJUNCT class alongside it, you can not do well in 134 without it unless ur a genius at math
imho Lucas is down the middle among stat professors at berkeley, not the best but not the worst. he’s a bit dry but teaches the content in an extremely organized fashion 

experience: fall 2019 stat 135
Never take anything with Lucas.
I would have taken Data 140
adam is dry as hell and the 134 textbook isn't great, but overall I thought the class was pretty low workload and not terrible. it just looks awful compared to data 140 or eecs 126.

stat 135 with adam was probably the worst class I took at berkeley in  terms of educational quality though. Just a bunch of random statistical tests with no intuition behind them, and the textbook was abysmal.
This class sucks balls!
stat 134 and 135 almost single-handedly made me drop my stats major.
Very difficult but interesting class. Lucas's lectures are pretty straightforward, but they're more of a supplement to the textbook than a standalone resource, focusing on lots of understanding checks and example problems. Basically you gotta read the textbook to understand the ideas, and lectures are for practice and reinforcement.
They discontinued the adjunct course starting from this semester :((((, but there is a weekly topic review! Better than nothing lol
How does it compare to say CS 189 or EECS 127? (I don’t have any point of reference and I’m enrolled for next sem)
Easier and less work, but much worse of a class."

thanks!","[Here's a review of Stat 134](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uptwui/stat_134_thoughts_and_advice/) by someone who took it with Lucas sometime last year, and here's [the website of the course](http://www.stat134.org/) from Spring 2023; it contains some outlines / worksheets that contain the concepts taught in the class."
Tips for Stat 135?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13o757c/tips_for_stat_135/,2023-05-21 14:38:03,"Taking 134 with Adam Lucas traumatized me so Im not really looking forward to seeing him again next semester in 135. I havent heard as many bad things about 135 with him but still, I’d like to know how everyone’s experience in stat 135 is so I can prepare myself well…","Stat 134 is much more math intensive than 135 where (you use algebraic manipulation and other mathematical techniques to solve problems) whereas 135 has a lot of set formulas and procedures that are easy to follow. He lets you bring cheat sheets to the midterm and final so it is not a problem to memorize them. Personally I found 134 to be more intuitive as I am a math major and am used to all the techniques used there. But most other people I have heard prefer 135. I would definitely recommend going to his lectures too as the book doesn’t align completely with his lectures.
Do you know what textbook he uses for Stat 135? Is there a pdf I can access so I can get a feel for what the course entails?
Ya it’s Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis by John Rice 3rd Ed. You should be able to find a pdf on libgen

Stat 134 Curve/Averages,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sqofao/stat_134_curveaverages/,2022-02-12 02:14:16,Does anybody know what the averages have been in past semesters for midterms and finals in Stat 134 taught by Adam Lucas? I've heard that the class curve is really brutal but I'm not super sure if it's because everybody fails the test or if everybody does really well.,"Fall 2021 MT Stats:   


Midterm Statistics:  
Mean: 22.2  
Median: 20.0  
Minimum: 0.0

Standard Deviation: 11.31

It's the exams that differentiates the grades since everyone basically gets full score on the hw.
Curve is not brutal. I think the cutoff for an A was like a 75% for my semester.
Thanks!! Are these scores out of something or is the mean a 22%?

Math 54 or Stat 134,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kq6dez/math_54_or_stat_134/,2021-01-04 02:47:37,"Hey guys.

The classes I have currently on my schedule are:

Math 53
Stat 134
Cs61a
Colwrit r1a ( the 6 unit one )

I wanted to drop stat 134 and take math 54. For those who have taken both or those who know about both, is math 54 a lighter load that stat 134 or are they almost the same? Also, stat 134 is with Adam Lucas and math 54 is with Katrin Wehrheim.","Math 54 is way easier than stat 134
also want to add when i took math 54 with Wehrheim, they seemed to have the easiest exams. i barely studied for the midterms/finals (only briefly looked over past notes and did maybe 2 practice exams at most each time) and got over 90% on all the exams, and their lectures are also pretty organized and good!
Stat 134 is less work but is more difficult.

That's not uncommon for upper division Math/Stat courses. Lower division courses tend to have long tedious problem sets.

(I in took both Stat 134 and Math 54 in the same semester.)
Never take Stat 134 with Adam Lucas! Horrid professor
Ah okay. That said, What do you think about my schedule difficulty. I'm a bit confused because Im still not able to properly gauge the difficulty levels at Cal lol.
This sounds promising lol. But yeah the reviews i read on rate my professor said that but I didn't want to believe those cause they're pretty extreme.
I disagree with  

That's not uncommon for upper division Math/Stat courses. Lower division courses tend to have long tedious problem sets.

Although its true here
Seconded
I did Stat 134 and CS61A last semester and it was difficult but doable. I think my friend did Math 53 and Stat 134 together and he had a harder time. 

If you’re new to coding, I would advise against your current schedule and swap for math 54 instead. CS1A can be very time consuming if you don’t have experience with Python ( specifically recursions, OOP, etc. ). For CS61A, I recommend starting on projects early and studying past exams religiously. 

Stat 134 with Lucas was not a great time either. The content is definitely difficult but doable if you grind a lot of problems out. However, the worse part was the disorganization (ex: giving out practice exams with wrong answers and didn’t reply to any students asking for clarification up to the exam day) and lack of empathy for students. If you decide to take it, I 100% recommend taking the adjunct with Mike. I started the class with Fs and Cs on quizzes, but ended the class with an A. Finding a study group helps too because my friend and I met up every other day during dead week to study. The cutoff is pretty nice though: 

A+ 93,
A 80,
A- 75,
B+ 71,
B 67,
B- 63,
C+ 56,
C 49
C- 40

Keep in mind that exam averages are usually around the low 60s percent and final averages are historically below 50%. 

I took Math 54 in the summer and it was definitely a lot easier than Stat 134. Linear algebra isn’t a walk in the park, but you can definitely do decent by just memorizing rules. You can’t do that with Stat 134 because it’s a lot of problem solving. I personally LOVED Math 54, it’s much more intuitive. 

It really depends on you though. I think your schedule is doable but it won’t be easy if you don’t have experience with programming AND don’t have any experience with probability.
yeah that’s understandable since a lot of other 54 profs seem to make the class unreasonably difficult. if you have the chance, take the adjunct for the class as well! i’d definitely recommend it, i was only able to stay in the adjunct for part of the semester while taking 54 and i didn’t have to do any extra studying during that time because the adjunct prepped me so well. good luck!
Thanks for this! For next sem, I'm thinking of dropping stat 134 and doing stat 140 sometime later. So I'd have math 53, cs61a and the r&c. I'm now thinking if I should add math 54 to it.
Ah yes will definitely take the adjunct section! Thanks
I think it’s doable with Math 54! 

I heard Stat 140 is a lot better than stat 134. I wish I took it instead 😭😭
Cool. I think I'll take 54 too and see what happens in the sem. Yeah a lot of people said 140 is better
You should read up on the differences between the various probability classes at Berkeley:  http://prob140.org/about/

140 adds a computing and statistical inference component on top of what 134 offers.  It’s the preferred probability class for DS students and for some CS students.  You should have taken Data 8 prior. Also, Prof Adhikari is one of the great lecturers at Berkeley and her lecture attendance rates are always very high, especially since she rarely records any of her lectures."

i think stat88's a great course, with awesome course staff! i'd recommend it. the distribution for the MT was really nice, and adhikari says she doesnt plan on intentionally trying to lower the class distribution (bc we killed the midterm).
Stat 88 will be less work and has significantly nicer grade distributions than stat 20.
Stat 20 would be more rigorous and probably a bit better preperation for upper division courses, but I took 88 and have turned out fine as an econometrics focused econ major.
Thank you! I’ll probably take 88 then.

don't know if it still counts for stats requisite but i took pbhlth 142 and it was great! the >100 course number threw me off at first but tbh it was a pretty doable, intro course. its easy to get the hang of R quickly (as opposed to python in data 8, which is also easy but might be slightly more intimidating to someone with no coding experience). plus the class is about statistics in public health which might appeal more to those with a premed/bio interest. i also took stat 20 afterwards and found that I liked pbhlth 142 better overall.
such an easy class 😍😍
The course is actually not that difficult if you have a pure math background
For once, you said something useful Little Man
what do you mean by stat 2 being too introductory? if that’s the case sign me up lol
Nobody here said it didn’t count. Just questioning it lol
yeah so easy. just look at his mt2 distribution from last semester🙃

Help scheduling for Sophomore CS major trying to pursue a IEOR minor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g1ifvh/help_scheduling_for_sophomore_cs_major_trying_to/,2020-04-14 18:33:21,"Hey guys, I'm going to be a sophomore in fall 2020 and I was having some trouble planning out my courses.

I'm going to declare CS over the summer (I'm still undeclared L&S right now) and I wanted to pick up an IEOR minor. By the looks of it, the first pre-req in getting the IE minor (which is IE 172) is going to be full before my enrollment slot (April 29th), so I'll probably have to take STAT 134 in place of it. I don't know anyone who's taken this class, and the RateMyProfessor on the Professor teaching in the fall seems to have reviews all over the place (Adam R. Lucas).

I don't have the strongest math background, so I wanted to know if it seems doable or like too much work to do CS 61C, CS 170, and STAT 134 all in the same semester + a seminar and some CS AI-ing. Have you guys had positive or negative experiences with this class?

To anyone that's pursued an IEOR minor: how did you approach the pre-reqs? Did you end up having to take the equivalent STAT courses or did you get into the IE classes?","If you want to get a good grade, 134 takes a crap ton of work. The hard part of the class is really chapters 4-6, which CS70 doesn't really cover that thoroughly. If you have time to spare, take the adjunct course from the SLC and you'll almost certainly get an A or high B. 

 Re: the workload - if you're a strong student you'll probably be fine, just busy 24/7. Some people can take 4 techs a semester while some (like me) have their hands full with just 2. So YMMV.
Thank you so much!"
