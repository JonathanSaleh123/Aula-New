UGBA107 Summer Session with Alan Ross,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gpe10z/ugba107_summer_session_with_alan_ross/,2020-05-23 15:27:11,"I just enrolled in the business course, UGBA107 for the summer but am also taking UGBA155 and have an internship. How hard and time consuming is UGBA 107 in the summer? Is it definitely something manageable in addition to what else I have going on?  Or, would you suggest taking 1 of the 3 things off my plate? Is UGBA 155 pretty easy? Thanks!!","Im planning to take 155 too! Looking at the grade distributions, 155 looks pretty easy.. over 65% of the class got some sort of A last summer so you should probably be okay
Okay, good to know! For UGBA155, did you have to purchase a license for $27 for the first pre class assignment called SLPI 360?"

Wow I‚Äôm actually really impressed /u/chabanais, the most sensitive snowflake of all, left his safe space at /r/conservative and posted in a subreddit where he can‚Äôt just ban everyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with him.
What is your opinion of the cartoon and what do you think of the chancellor's reaction to it?
Yeah seriously. This post is the Reddit equivalent of a homeless man trying to get you to watch him jerk off at a bus stop. 
Thanks for weighing in on the anti-Semitic cartoon.
who gives a fuck.  nothing will change because of this cartoon.  its all spectacle and i could care less what the chancellor has to say.  
Sure I‚Äôll bite.

How exactly is the cartoon anti-Semitic?
Insightful.

Thanks!

What do you think of the cartoon? 
cool keep on owning libs or whatever gives you sense of importance.  
Thanks for avoiding the question.

Regarding that link- I think whoever wrote the complaint about the cartoon doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. ‚ÄúBlood Libel‚Äù refers to the accusation that Jews used the blood of Christians in rituals. It has nothing to do with the geopolitics of the Israeli state. That‚Äôs like saying a cartoon showing a Muslim jihadist wearing a turban is Islampphobic because of Mohammed‚Äôs crusades against Christians.

I think that the cartoon ignores the violence perpetuated by the Palestinians against the Israelis and is clearly biased against Israel. However, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anti Semitic. You can be opposed to actions taken by the Israeli government because of their actions as a state, not because of the religion associated with the country. For example I‚Äôm opposed to Saudi Arabia funding terrorism.. but that doesn‚Äôt make me anti-Islamic. My opposition to their actions has nothing to do with their religion, it has to do with the violence that their actions cause.

Basically I think you calling this cartoon anti Semitic due to its message against Israel‚Äôs actions is the equivalent of a leftist calling all conservatives racist for wanting to enforce border laws. Both are intellectually lazy, dishonest, and intentionally misrepresent opposing viewpoints for the sake of avoiding actual discussion.
Thanks for the reply.

Insightful!
You asked:

>How exactly is the cartoon anti-Semitic?

I provided a link that answers this question fairly specifically. 

Putting a Jew in a stockade and holding him up to ridicule is the main thing. 

""Illegal immigrant"" is not a race. 
So because the person is Jewish, it makes it anti Jewish? So any cartoon of Obama or Clinton in a stockade wasn't racist or sexist but this on is? Why is that? Do you think the cartoons purpose was to attack all Jewish people or perhaps just Alan? I can only assume you deleted all Hillary cartoons on rconservative because, using your logic, that would be sexist.

&nbsp; 

Edit: I'm surprised to see you out of your safe space. If you stay away from rcon long enough, it might clear up that brain disorder.
The link you provided says the cartoon is anti-Semitic because it ‚Äúconnects directly to the centuries-old ‚Äúblood libel‚Äù that falsely accused Jews of engaging in ritual murder‚Äú. That‚Äôs completely irrelevant to Israeli-Palestinian politics. No one, including the cartoonist, is accusing Israel of using the blood of Palestinians in rituals. And even if they were it‚Äôs still not blood libel.. which was claimed to be directed against Christianity.

How is this cartoon ‚Äúholding him up to ridicule‚Äù? It‚Äôs clearly not a stockade.. what kind of stockade has drawings of flowers and sunshine on it? It‚Äôs clearly a visualization of the ‚Äústaged‚Äù presentation of Israel. That is the point the cartoonist is clearly conveying- that the real Israel is not what we‚Äôre  presented with in western media.

I never said ‚Äúillegal immigrant‚Äù is a race. In fact the whole point of that sentence was pointing out that it‚Äôs ridiculous when people call conservatives racist for border control, something that you actually agree with, but you‚Äôre so argumentative for the sake of being argumentative you seem to have missed that point.

If you really care about anti Semitism you might want to mod your subreddit a bit more carefully. Even though you banned me for saying Trump is more authoritarian than conservative and then called me a name for it, I still browse /r/conservative, because apparently censorsing opposing viewpoints is now a conservative principle. The amount of claims that Jews are secretly taking over the world that I see in the comments there is fairly surprising.. in fact it‚Äôs the only place I see that sort of thing on Reddit.
So if you had a cartoon of Obama in chains you would not evoke slavery? 

Using anti-Semitic imagery to mock someone who is Jewish is bigoted. 

If there was a cartoon showing Hillary doing the dishes and throwing a tampon then that would be sexist,  yes. 
If the there is any anti-Semitism in r/conservative please PM the mods or me so it can be removed that has no place in civil discourse. 


I will- thanks for looking out. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the alt-right types align themselves with conservatives/Republicans just like how antifa aligns itself more or less with Democrats.. really wish all of them could fuck off and leave their hate at the door.
If you read Richard Spenser's Tweets he calls for things that I would not call to be ""Conservative"" such as universal heatlhcare.  Aligning oneself with something and actually being something are two different things.

The issue with Antifa is pretty much most of ""the Left"" covers for them.
Here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs just as easy and no more true to say that from the other side. Someone who only reads left-leaning news sources could easily claim that most of the right covers for the alt-right by the fact that one of the leaders of the alt-right movement (Bannon) was put in the White House by the current Republican President. That‚Äôs a lot more than Democrats have done for Antifa, who are universally known to be complete asshats by every liberal I‚Äôve ever spoken to. No one likes the fact that they completely invalidate otherwise peaceful protests. It gives people who want to shut down protests a legitimate reason to do so when they turn them into riots, and on a personal level I think they‚Äôre complete pussies the way they ‚Äúattack‚Äù wearing masks. I don‚Äôt know where you got the idea that ‚Äúmost of the left covers for them‚Äù but it‚Äôs complete bullshit likely manufactured by Breitbard or some other very right wing group looking to discredit ‚Äúthe left‚Äù.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to vary your source of news and use critical thinking to sift out the bullshit.
I didn't say Antifa is the same as the Democrats.  What I said was many Democrats cover for Antifa.  You don't see Republicans doing something similar with 'white supremacists.'  A *few* Democrats came out against Antifa after what they did in Berkeley, but that's about all I can say on that.

People on the Left throw around 'alt right' like it means something.  Ben Shapiro has been called 'alt right' which is absurd.  I ask people what proof do you have about Bannon and I get 'Breitbart.'  That's not proof... that's a website.

"Star Parker, a conservative activist, visited Alan Ross' Political Science 179 to address issues of urban poverty. She offered five policy proposals including ending abortion subsidies and welfare entitlement reform. She'd requested anonymity prior to event because she was concerned for her safety.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/04/13/conservative-activist-star-parker-speaks-urban-poverty-campus-class/,2017-04-13 23:45:49,,"From the description of her views given, I probably don't agree with most of them, however I am very glad she spoke to the class because I think that exposure to a wide variety of political beliefs makes for the most complete and best political science education. 

Also, I do think that a collapse of ethics is partially responsible for some of society's ills...though I may not agree with her proposed ways of fixing them. I think that had I heard her in person, I would be better fleshing out my own ideas right about now, as perhaps the students are doing, and which is usually a good thing. I am glad that she was received respectfully.
When I took PS179 we had the chair of the CA GOP (I think) come speak to us. I didn't have any problems with the guy speaking but I only agreed with him in the area of personal privacy/surveillance issues. Otherwise he talked about how liberals wanted everyone to ride bikes and live in high rises; no SUV's, no homes or whatever. 

He also took a couple minutes to explain how the transition to low-flush toilets crippled the sewer system in the bay area at the time. That was an unforeseen consequence so a lot of money had to be spent to revamp the sewer system so it could accommodate the lower flows of water--but I'm not sure I took away the message he was trying to send. At that time the drought in CA was in full force, so if he was trying to advocate for elimination of ""wasteful regulation"" then he was doing a pretty terrible job.

Anyways, with all that his talk went off without a hitch. It was absurd, but it didn't need me acting out to emphasize that point."

"Carol Christ to Daily Cal: Your recent editorial cartoon targeting Alan Dershowitz was offensive, appalling and deeply disappointing. I condemn it. Are you aware its anti-Semitic imagery connects directly to the centuries-old 'blood libel' that falsely accused Jews of engaging in ritual murder?",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/24/editorial-cartoon-targeting-alan-dershowitz-perpetuates-harmful-stereotypes/,2017-10-24 23:01:00,,"just when things were quietening down, some idiot has to start shit up again. uggh i can so smell another free speech week incoming cuz of this stupid shit. can we just make him bend over for milo and move along like nothing happened? 
It was pretty anti-Semitic, but showing a soldier killing a non-combatant is *hardly* depicting a Jewish person in the act of ritual vampirism upon a Christian child. The grotesque body was insensitive enough; no need to make more of the cartoon than was there. Dershowitz is loving this, however. It's the perfect point of outrage for Israel apologists to zero in on, all the while Palestinians still have their land and lives taken by an unlawful occupation.
I fucking cannnot compute how its blood libel, its reference to actually physical slaughter that is actually occurring in the real world now. Its criticism of soldiers killing civilians outside of Isreal in occupied Palestine. If 'blood libel' is when the IDF kills civilians then shit, its not really libel... or even unique to jews.

I don't even buy that the cartoon is antisemitic. Its not supposed to be a depiction of Israelis, its a depiction of a monster state commiting atrocities while covering them up. The cartoon isn't supposed to be nice. It would be different if the cartoon was supposed to be a depiction of Israelis - like Antijewish propaganda posters in 3rd Reich Germany - but this isn't that. This is the criticism of a state. The complaint about the body is analogous to demanding cartoons criticizing America depict uncle Sam in a non-grotesque way. Furthmore, the cartoon didn't even play on stereotypes like large noses which would have been anti-semitic. 

Its insane that any criticism of Isreal as a state is anti-semetic.
Is Carol Christ literally retarded? How is the cartoon depicting child-libel? Shooting a kid (which happens all the time) != a highly specific case of medieval cannbibalism-ritual sacrifice allegations. Woah, it's almost like pro-Israelis are paranoid about this kinda stuff because they feel secretly guilty. 
Enough with this 'let's just keep our heads down and be quiet' bs. It doesn't work. Berkeley is this icon in the culture's mental landscape -- undeservedly so tbh. So people like Dershowitz (look up 'hatchet man') or Milo or whoever will always come here for a bully pulpit. 
This is the first time in a long time I've 100% agreed with you on something. I think it's a pretty poorly done cartoon (it's Daily Cal, idk what I expected), and it's definitely got some racist/antisemtic undertones... but to go so far as to say that the imagery represents blood libel?  Hmm, that's assuming that Daily Cal is capable of such complex symbolism. 
Palestinians had like 7 wars to try to take israel and got murked in all of them at a certain point you have to acknowledge who's king of the hill right
It is totally not anti-semitic, and to say it is anti-semitic IS anti-semitic. The dead-kid (i didn't notice it was a kid tbh, it looks like teen or man) is not the same as the allegation of ritual-cooking and cannibalizing that is blood libel. Do you mean to say that whenever a Jew kills a child, one cannot accuse of them of doing so for fear of being accused of blood-libel-anti-semitism? I hate to break it to you but some pedophiles are Jewish and the D.A certainly doesn't give a fuck about the muhantisemitism-blood-libel-defense.

u got a solution? lets hear it.
Honestly, it's a pretty well-done cartoon -- objectively speaking. As in, it is clever and well-drawn and communicates effectively -- so effectively that this retired Harvard Professor got triggered. 
I mean, I really hope we're not judging right and wrong by military power. I know that, at the end of the day, we really are, but I'd rather at least *try* not to. Also it doesn't justify any peacetime affronts.
The Arabs were not real states in the 48' war, they were former Ottoman provinces that had been won by Britain/France and given Mandate-status and then 'independence' under pro-British Monarchs and armies literally staffed with British officers. 
You seem to understand history like carol understands antisemitism. 
I never said that. The anti-Semitism is rooted in what is, at the very least, an incredibly insensitive, and historically precedented, dehumanizing of the body.
What would an appropriate cartoon to criticize the state of Israel for murdering Palestinian civilians in Palestine while manipulating with west with PR look like to you?

Apparently, it cannot feature and blood as this is a reference to ritualistic child vampirism, nor the media, as this is a reference to media deception.
And even if it couldn't be seen as anti-Semitic, even if it didn't have historical precedent, why give him ammunition? Dershowitz calls literally everything an attack, so why give him an easy opportunity? It's infuriatingly short-sighted by the cartoonist.
Also, just so you know, the chancellor, and Dershowitz are both calling blood libel on the cartoon. They are not saying ""Greedy Merchant"" with  arachnid body.
Are we actually talking about the same cartoon?

The ""Happy Merchant"" has a exaggerated nose, no glasses, mustache, extensive facial hair, ceremonial head covering, beard, curled hair. He looks wholly different than character in the UC cartoon. I can't see any similarity at all. 

The arachnid body? I couldn't tell he was a spider, nor did I know that arachnid is a common antisemitic stereotype. 
Is it anti-semitic to say that Dershowitz literally looks a little Jewish? Many Jews do, and it's a joke among Jews that some Jews look more 'jewish' than others.
1. Stop selling this meme of ""berkeley is the heart of free speech"". It's not. The historical movement was brutally put-down and it's members totally blacklisted for life for their 'free speech'. Are you familiar with the concept of 'virtue signaling', the university does this with the 'free speech movement' and sells it to recruit impressionable young students. Stop. 
2. Organize pre-emptive right-wing or left-wing debates with strawman ""our guys"" right-wingers or left-wingers -- so as to take the wind out of the sail of these campus-visitors. 
3. Stop the hypocrisy and speak sincerely. If campus cares about free speech, then care about it. It doesn't. It cares about looking good  (good optics) and staying on the good side of powerful people and institutions elsewhere. That's the real identity -- sucking up to power, pretending to be otherwise than you are, and crying about it if it leads you into trouble. There is no sense of stewardship of the institution of Berkeley, only high-placed administrators or faculty looking out for their next-gig. 
The combined Arab countries definitely had more military power than Israel - they got a lot of tries but just couldn't execute. Sad! 
As was Israel.  And practically from the day of Israel's establishment, its neighboring countries have (with very few exceptions) attempted to end its existence.  It's not terribly surprising that Israelis have a fortress mentality.

None of which excuses any human rights violations the Israeli state is responsible for, of course.  But you know, at least in Israel wives don't have to ask their husbands' permission before leaving the country.
Dershowitz looks like that. Some Jews look characteristically Jewish. This is a fact. Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and Seth Rogan even joke about it. Do you think the Aryan-beauty ideal is superior? I don't, that's why I don't think it's anti-semitic to lampoon an obviously Jewish man. Or do you think it is dehumanizing and therefore anti-semitic to show the truth of what Israel does to children of Palestinian identity (many of whom are also semitic)?
[deleted]
So you think free speech should be totally curtailed so that Dershowitz -a defender of murder -- doesn't get triggered about defending murder? So we should not talk about rape-culture and powerful men raping women so that rapists don't get triggered?

1. a lot of times its not what is but what people think it is. if someone gives me a prize for being a thoughtful human with a 10,000 check im not just gonna give it back. publicity matters even if its questionable. trump's presidential run was the perfect example for it. its not that i dont understand where you're coming from but the most straight forward moves usually doesnt equate the best ones.


2. whos gonna debate? look at the guys that go up for Q&A during shapiro event. do they sound smart to you? and when people debate their beliefs they get so emotional like fukin goons. the brightest people i met wont ever give a shit about it that means you can never have an even debate of ideas when the intelligence level is different/low. most of the arguments on both sides can be read online so IMO i dont think its a way forward. What would actually be productive if the right tried to argue on the left while the left tried to argue on the right. at that point i think things might actually get somewhere.


3. of course good optics matter more today. public colleges are broke and have to run like businesses. money speaks volumes. of course free speech matters. but look at google and the memo saga. how is the school funded, where it gets its research $ from? compared to decades ago more and more from corporate/donors/students. how many right wing companies donate to the school? now compare how many tech/research/banks donate/contribute to the school and what are their beliefs and values?
 your values represent where your money comes from, just like politics. pretty straight forward.

Israel was supported by France and the US and even Soviets during the first war. Israel lost the Yom kippur war and had to be bailed out by the US from Incirlik at the 11th hour. US air-lifted guns, tanks, fighter jets into Tel-Aviv and apparently even manned some of them. 

""husband's permission""
This is only true in the states in the ME that Israel is allied to, like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Emirates (Dubai). Syria, Egypt, Iraq, etc. were not and are not this evil islamist boogeyman. Neither is Iran. Iran has more women PhD students and women in STEM than the U.S. or Germany.
I mean, I'm not attracted to Dersho, but I sure as hell don't think he looks like a beady little arachnid. My entire point is that it's insensitive. It shouldn't be a big outcry, but the whole thing is the product of an unduly strong pro-Israel (note: not pro-Jewish, not Jewish in nature) presence in the US, which attacks even the smallest flaws in any critique of Israel to be indicative of Nazi-like sentiment in the US.
Its critical of the government without mentioning the murder of civilians by foreign soldiers or America's support for Israel. Which is proof that you can criticize Israel in a tame and wholly inoffensive way.

The school cartoon was supposed to criticize how America is manipulated, and not seeing whats going on behind the scenes. I think its hard to make the case for bloodshed without blood, I think its hard to make the case for manipulating American liberals without some kind of deception being implicit. I don't think blood is per se antisemitic when associated with actual acts of bloodshed by a state. 

Blood is a reality man. At what point are the facts just anti-Semitic? I an innocent is killed by a solider and bleeds and someone takes a photo, is that anti-Semitic?
You are the only one claiming anti-semetic owing to use of spider body - which I do not see. The official line is its blood libel - which is emphatically senseless garbage written to delegitimize criticism of Israel. 

The face on the spider thing is closer to the UC cartoon than the ""happy/greedy merchent"". Its not a greedy merchant cartoon. 

I am not sure if the original artist intended his drawing to be a spider or not, but cartooning all jews as parasitic arachnids preying on white women is different than cartooning the state as a monster. 

The arachnid cartoon has spider limbs, and a clear spider body in a spider web. The UC cartoon has human limbs. The only similarity is a circular body. Weather this is intended to reference the cartoon I cannot say with certainty, but perhaps the state is just supposed to be a monster. You also have to remember the argument the cartoons make are very different. The arachnid cartoon says All jews are predatory subhumans who trap vulnerable white women. Which is clearly antisemetic. The second says Israel is a monster has bamboozled liberals and is killing innocents without there knowledge. This is not anti-semetic.

1. What? So Berkeley should just lie about it's history because Trump is President? Berkeley has been doing this since the 90s, possibly earlier. Real FSMers all dropped out (after profs refused to grade their work, or admin harassed them, go read some biographies bro), got expelled, and ended up in very dark paths. A few like Alice Waters ended up going back to school years later and becoming famous by entrepreneurship (no-one would hire them). That's what the university should teach, because it's true, and it's not a fairy tale muh triumphalist liberal 60s-were-great propaganda. FSM is in truth a deterrent to free speech. Maybe you wish FSM had turned out differently and you think it's ok to mislead people because of a greater-ideal purpose Batman 'The Dark Night' Harvey  Dent thing? In which case, you're literally teaching 'false consciousness'. Good job. 
2. If CNN can find some fake-right-winger and Fox can find some fake-left-winger to bring on for fake-debates. Then so can Berkeley. Bring classy people, like Tucker Carlson. Or Stephen Kotkin (who is a Berkeley grad and Prof at Princeton and famous Conservative with a brain. He speaks at Yale Republican Club and other Republican clubs). 
3. Michigan and Virginia are not broke. Many public schools are not broke, even without funding from the public. Berkeley just complains and complains. It gets the research money from the feds for DARPA-related work mostly or Big Science. Or big companies. Monsanto gave money to Agriculture and Nutritional Science, next thing you know, we had purple-hair-dyed cute leftist girls running around campus saying ""not all GMOs, Guys!"". 

You don't understand. Berkeley claims to be FSM, it's not. It should never claim the FSM-mantle to begin with. Stop talking about it. Go by the law, no more, no less. It claims to be a special place of free speech, It's not. 

Optics are an issue of course. Berkeley personalities like Carol or Dirks or various Profs care about their individual personal optics at the expense of the University. Rather than defend Daily Cal's free speech, Carol caves in record-time because Dershowitz is a notoriously vengeful academic with wide-reach. Dershowitz has literally gotten profs un-tenured or grad-students expelled because of their free speech. He was ruined people's lives, he has gotten people fired from cozy board seats or directorships. When was the last time Dershowitz donated to Cal?

Cal is run/staffed/administered/payrolls-out-to and by a bunch of idiot SJW with fetishized memories of the 60s and with a chip on their should about being the first woman to do this or that or the first minority to do this or that. It's not run with brutal technocratic efficiency and prowess -- which it should be. That's basic. As long as you got that technocratic brutalism, you can put a facade of cuddly liberal feel goods on top. But if you don't have that and you try to be a cutesy tolerant false-reality, you're gonna have a bad time. 
So we shouldn't criticize rapists for raping for fear of upsetting rapists? 

You basically believe that the Israeli lobby is so powerful that it is impossible and un-advisable to upset their narrative? Why are they so powerful? Is their power democratically justifiable? How has the strongest country on earth allowed a small middle eastern state to colonize it's media/academia/political establishment/discourse?

i dont think the SJW theme only occurs in Cal. listen to the admin in any prestigious university including the ivys. they all sound like clones of one another. 


and yes i do believe that i totally understand your view point on every single issue you bring up. theres a quote i think applies here. children talk about whats right and wrong. adults only judge on pros and cons.
We shouldn't criticize rapists by drawing them in a way which criticizes by pointing to physical deformity-- and especially not to certain racially motivated physiologies-- as part of the issue. If they drew him looking like Larry David, nobody would have any reason to care.

They're so powerful because: a) they're more or less a weapons testing ground for the entire Western world. It's hard to know how good military tech is without using it on humans, and Israel does that very well. b) Because many Christians in America feel a savior complex towards Israel (while also being very anti-Semitic themselves). c) Because there are a lot of wealthy people who are rigidly pro-Israel. This isn't democratically justifiable. I'm against Israel, fundamentally, as it exists. And as to how they colonized so effectively: money and industrial concerns.
Well, I may be retarded. But, I simply cannot fathom how any association of blood with the Jews is now racist b/c blood libel was/is a thing.

This is a state - not a religion or ethnicity . This is a state being criticized for actual violence it commits, rather than mythical ritualistic violence of a ethnicity. It seems ridiculous to me that for all time, Israel can never be accused of manipulating people (thats what states do), or responsible for the blood of civilians it kills.

Saying the IDF is a bunch of jewish vampires who kidnap and murder palestinian children and collect their blood is antisemetic. Saying the IDF kills innocents and that this is bloodly is not. IF the picture showed any kind of collection of blood, any kind of reference of ritual consumption, the pouring of blood onto a ritual object, that would be anti-semetic blood libel. Blood libel is not the same thing as blood. this is such an insane argument. Blood libel is hyperspecific, its the killing of christian children to collect their blood for use in baked goods associated with a Holiday. I cannot fathom how any blood per se, without reference to the other elements is at all is antisemitic. Similarly, if the picture showed all news outlets being controlled by the jews this might be antisemetic. If the picture shows American liberals being manipulated by Israel this isn't the same thing.

if, this is not anti-semetic b/c of the depiction of blood, the corporeal depiction of israel, or the stage (which you referenced) than I cannot understand how it is.


I feel like these arguments are a stretch. They take something that has any connection at all to ethnicity (Israel=> Jews), (blood => blood libel), and stretch them to create an elaborate, politically motivated sense of offense based on hypothetical intent of speaker, writer, artist.

OK. I'm for all of that. If only Cal could pull it off -- but Cal can't. Ivies are not transparently incompetent like Cal is. 30+ year of live-action-role-playing as a savy cynical realist has not worked. It's time to reconsider first principles.

Cal is OG Sjw. Anyway, this is what happens when you let washed-up-hippies and their offspring play at power. They pretend to put-away their idealism and be 'realistic' cynics. They suck at it, and they're just bad, poorly skilled, low-effort, bad. Not to mention, their cynicism itself is idealistic.

That's anti-semitic. He's not physically deformed just because he looks a certain way. He's even proud of it, when he was casting for Reversal of Fortune, he made sure to get someone that captured his characteristic beady eyes and large nose (I'm not joking here). https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B13fDbQ75Sk/maxresdefault.jpg

>""Powerful""

The West does OK testing it's weapons itself. Israel doesn't test anything exciting, it mostly bombs and shoots people using known weaponry.

The Christians in America with the evangelical take on things are really special. They believe that Israel has to be supported because it is the sign of the apocalypse and the end-of-times, and so to literally destroy the world and prepare it for Jesus Christ's return, Israel must be defended. They didn't always believe this, only starting in earnest post-world-war2. And Israeli definitely plays it up, they have deep ties with the evangelical right -- and this includes left and right-wing Israeli governments.

>""Wealthy people"". 

Is the characteristic cause of their pro-Israeli stance their wealth or something else? American Jewish support for Israel is nothing new. Wealthy American Jews started and funded the best Israeli Universities, incl. Hebrew University, and the city of Tel-Aviv was built by Wealthy American and European Jews. The Birthright program and various lobby initiatives are funded by Wealthy American jews too. It's beyond left-or-right. Edward Said has said that his writings or interviews at Haaretz could never be published in the NYT or any American newspaper, many of whom have a deeply jewish cultural history and pro-israeli stance.

I had Ross before. He probably realized that few people actually wanted to listen to Lee. He's not obligated to let any of them speak at a lecture series that he hosts; Ross can pick whatever speakers he wants.
If Lee has any popular support whatsoever then he should start gathering signatures.

If a candidate wants to run for office it is incumbent upon them to demonstrate that they have supporters. If you give a platform to anybody who wants to run simply because they want to run you end up with anarchy.

IB 104LF,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rxz6vi/ib_104lf/,2022-01-06 20:58:28,has anyone taken this course with alan shabel? i saw that the avg grade was a B and was wondering how much effort i need to put in to get an a- or above ..,"I took it last spring, ended up getting an A- which honestly was pretty generous because I waited way too long on my final project and really didn‚Äôt put much effort in it. That being said, doing well on exams is important, the class isn‚Äôt curved and to my recollection neither were any individual exams. You will need to put in the effort to identify and learn the names of native species of birds, herps, and mammals- with the latter two also requiring Latin names. Exams were definitely fair and representative of the lectures, but not something you could get away without studying for. If your class ends up having an open note policy for exams like ours did, you will need to provide answers to a deeper understanding than just what‚Äôs explicitly stated on lecture slides. The other big grade component I alluded to earlier is the final project, which is mostly just a big time commitment and planning is your friend. Overall the expectations for the project were low- especially if you opted for the research project over term paper options, and as long as you put in some clear effort it should be ok. The staff really just cares about getting people excited about field biology, if you‚Äôre looking for an easy A, that‚Äôs not what this class is for. 

The bird and herps professors this year will be different from who had previously been doing it for years because they are both teaching their specific herpetology and ornithology courses this semester. If you are primarily interested in either of these over mammals, I highly recommend just doing those ones specifically, they don‚Äôt truly require 104LF as a prerequisite especially if you send an email to them. I could not say enough things about how great these two professors are, Shabel is also great but it was really Bowie and McGuire who made the course so special for me. 

Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions :)
If the GSI is Jackie Childers, she would make the class a lot better even if you don't get lectures from Bowie. Maybe I'm biased because I was her URAP but she is genuinely a great person

What's the difference between lyft and uber?
This is also a valid code! But it doesn't support the Berkeley Campus Ambassadors (go bears) haha
Sorry we don't have anything like that at the moment, but if you think about just tell a friend to sign up. Then you can ride with them and still reap the benefits :)

that is unfortunate... perhaps you can bring another friend along and have them claim the credit so you can all go somewhere (on the cheap)
Based on their marketing, I think Lyft is trying to position themselves as friendly, and Uber is trying to position themselves as professional. The service is extremely similar though, you request a ride with your smartphone and someone comes to pick you up and take you where you're going.
Well they are both valid ride-sharing companies. However, at Lyft we don't use ridiculous surge pricing up to 8x like Uber so our fares can be more affordable than them as well. Basic FAQ's can be found here - https://www.lyft.me/help but feel free to continue to ask questions in here!"
Withdrawing for a semster,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gigunq/withdrawing_for_a_semster/,2020-05-12 11:14:10,"So I'm kinda lost at the moment. I know a lot people are struggling with massive financial and emotional burdens at the moment which are definitely more important than my problems, but I am dealing with a little quarter life crisis at the moment in regards to what to do with my life. The whole death thing and having to live with myself for the past couple months of COVID has made me question and wonder what I am doing with school and all. And not to be too tone deaf, but I am doing great in school for the most part and even in finding an internship and that sort of thing. So its not like I am having trouble, its more that I do not know if this is what I want to do with my life.

I have been listening to Alan Watts on Youtube and something he said about not wanting control and that once you know the future you won't want it because its lost all its surprise and that is what we really want in life. That really rung true with me. I am 18 at the moment in EECS, and I can already sorta predict my future for the most part as long as I maintain mediocre effort in my opinion. Not to say the major is easy, haha, I just mean mediocre passion towards the subjects and work.

I hear stories about people who really commit themselves blood and tears to their businesses or projects. However, I live my life with school as a grind and then watching TV or other hobbies as my free time to enjoy. I just really want that moment in my life where I commit entirely to something where it is my work time and my free time and I love it to death. I feel like the path my life is headed down at the moment by all accounts is fine and leagues above bad, but also lacks something I desperately want. I think the way it usually goes is that you live that life where your work is work and it supports you and that is just the life you have to live to get by, or you have the wonderful privilege to find something that makes you really passionate.

I have never been that passionate about EECS and that sort of thing to the degree that I would want to be towards something I commit so much time to, but I never had a major failure on my path, so I just figured it must be the path I am a good fit for. This has brought me success and the like, but it does not make me proud and overall has sorta muted my curiosity and original spark of interest in the field. I feel ridiculous and sorta entitled to say that I do not want to be successful and have a great quality of life by most standards, but I just cannot help but feel that there is something else out there for me.

I have many hobbies in art, music, and sports and I love them, but I do not know if that is what I want to do either. I've started becoming sorta self destructive in my actions when it comes to school, subconsciously trying to sabotage myself to give myself the failure to put myself on the hot seat and finally realize what I want to do, but that really just reminds me of that scene from the office where Andy shits on his boss' car to burn his bridges and pursue music. And I, like most people, hate Andy.

So now I am considering withdrawing or cancelling for fall semester since It will probably be a low quality high demand online education which does not fit me. I am not sure whether or not that is the right decision, because there is a very high chance I will just end up wasting my time watching bunch of TV and not doing anything. So I have to at least come up with an idea of alternative paths for myself that I would want and some sort of way to pursue those paths during these COVID times for a semester. Anyhow, best of luck to anyone struggling during these times.","I love Alan Watts. 

Edit your post to put some paragraphs in. Even Eeks can handle that. 

You‚Äôre going to be alright. If you have plugged into Alan Watts already, you are in the right place. Take advantage of being in Berkeley, as there is probably not a better place in the world for an Awakening EE. 

Don‚Äôt go mediocre on your studies unless you really don‚Äôt want to be an Eek. It‚Äôs a great field and will help you immensely in the decades ahead. 

I studied Poli Sci with Obama at CU and switched over to Math and CS post grad. Nothing better than keeping the lights on, believe me. 

This too shall pass. 

Ps 
Don‚Äôt abuse drugs and alcohol. That‚Äôs a big mistake. Use if you like, but don‚Äôt ab-use.
As someone who has been out in the world for a while, I can assure you that passion is overrated.

People who are looking for passion as a motivation are really looking for an excuse to avoid doing something that needs doing. Successful people attribute their success to passion, but that's survivorship bias and misidentifying the real reasons for their success. You don't hear from all the people who worked their asses off and had real aptitude for what they were doing but just weren't lucky.

The fact of the matter is that you tend to have a lot of fun and enjoy what you're doing when what you're doing is going well. For every person I know who joined a pre-IPO company and ended up with a good payout, there are literally scores of people who went to the same schools, took the same classes, got the same grades, worked the same weekends, and didn't have much more than their salaries to show for the same amount of time, effort and ability. Passion had nothing to do with it.

Waiting to find your passion is like the writer who only writes when ""inspired."" Strangely enough, those types of writers don't publish much of anything in their lifetimes. Meanwhile, the writer who ""gets inspired"" every day at 9 AM, researches until lunch and writes from the end of lunch until dinnertime and repeats this process every day is the one who actually gets published.

If, during your professional life, you don't absolutely despise what you're doing, you're doing fine. You're also allowed to have hobbies and change your career, but it's kind of a good idea to have a career to change from in the first place. Your work is something that enables your life -- it is, most assuredly, not the totality of your life.
This isn't unique to you or to life during this pandemic. Most young people go though something similar to what you're describing in their early 20's. The reason to bust your ass in your schoolwork is to build your mind, improve your ability to work with others, and develop technical skills and critical thinking patterns. If you do that, you'll have the skills and qualifications to do whatever you want in life.

Don't worry that you feel this way, in my experience it's only going to last a year or so and you'll come out of it finding what really gets you excited in life. You're lucky you're feeling this way right now, it hits most people *after* they graduate and then they're unable to utilize the amazing resources available to you right now at Berkeley to redirect themselves towards their goals.
I am definitely going to be replaying the Alan Watts talks for a good while.

I have never really posted on reddit before, I edited to have paragraphs.

And sadly, its the fact that I can have mediocre passion for something and still succeed that scares me to be honest. Another wonderful quote by Mr.Watts said that its ridiculous to pursue an unfulfilling life that you pursue to stay a live and ""keep the lights on"" just to live a life that is unfulfilling or something to that affect.

But being young, I understand I lack a lot of perspective. I just want to make sure to keep my options open early on.

Also PS: Drugs and alcohol have never, and hopefully never will be a problem for me :)

Thank you for your reply.

>I studied Poli Sci with Obama at CU and switched over to Math and CS post grad.

How'd you make a transition between two completely different fields? Idk if you went to grad school but the difference in course work is crazy between the two areas.
I think these feelings are relatable and I don't want to diminish them by calling them normal, but certainly they're not abnormal. 

As someone who is older and left school for similar reasons when I was a teenager, I can say that while I don't regret my many experiences they didn't necessarily help me achieve what it is you are looking for. That takes time. A lot of time. I think it's great if I meet young undergraduates who feel they have found their calling full on, which is common to see at Berkeley, but I also think it's great if you're questioning what you're doing and showing introspection, asking bigger questions. 

I think you can graduate Berkeley and have more options to explore with a degree, even if it's unrelated for what you want to pursue. Without a degree, this is much, much more difficult. While you are here, take classes outside your major you might find interesting, or will just enjoy, like art or music. Maybe even change your major. Explore a minor. I would encourage you to take smaller steps within what you already have as opposed to an extreme one, like dropping out of school, even if just for a semester. The unknown may seem appealing for it's seemingly limitless potential but the world is quite different when you are young and nothing vouches for you (like a degree) - on top of COVID circumstances.
Well, finding something your passionate about is a good thing. UCB will expose you to a lot of stuff. 

Eventually, you can move to L&S if your heart leads you there. 

Everybody is a little blue due to the Coronavirus.
I started teaching HS math after college as I was a little adrift. That piqued my interest and I went and backfilling what I needed before grad school. 

I went to a solid grad school but I was not a star there. Nonetheless, I got a good education and am a good college adjunct as well as programming professional. 

And, it took me a long time!"

**Regarding Data**

When we use digital services, we also trust the company behind it with our data.  Most times, we understand that explicitly giving the company permission to use the data collected in ways that directly benefit us.  Allowing that GPS app access to your telemetry helps it navigate you to where you need to go.  Sending a picture of your face to Snapchat servers gives you neat filters to hide that face blemish.  Of course, there is a tradeoff to consider.  For the overwhelming number of digital services that collect and use personal data, the end-user has no say over how that data is used once it makes its way back to the company‚Äôs servers.  What is the tradeoff between our privacy of data, convenience and security?  What would a useful compromise be, and is it worth it?

Personally, I don‚Äôt mind if a company uses my data to provide better recommendations, to improve the layout of a site to provide an easier to use interface, to propagate more popular content to the front page, or to find out what the most popular topics are among users for the sake of pushing out more of it.  One thing many people do take issue with, however, is the selling and trading of their data.

Companies sharing data about their users to partner companies for more effective ad-targeting, for example, is one thing.  However, consider the case where a company has so much information about their users, they can effectively custom-tailor marketing campaigns selling malicious services or products (think predatory loans or addictive activities) that can be as close to guaranteed effective.

While arguably difficult to classify an entity‚Äôs use data as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù, misuse and weaponization of data is a real issue.  A potential compromise would be legislation akin to the data regulation laws in the European Union, where citizens have a set of ‚Äúdigital rights‚Äù.  For services that collect data that does not feed back into the experience of a user with that service, companies can make available a pay-for-service, data-collection-free experience as an alternative to a free and data-collecting-supported services.^[1]

There is a concern that information the government collects on its citizens is used in unethical or malicious ways.  It has become well known that Edgar J. Hoover, the first Director of the FBI, during his time at the bureau used information at his disposal for arguably immoral and unethical purposes.  Subduing civil right groups and blackmailing elected officials.  While legislation has been introduced to help combat corruption in the face of such conduct, clearly abuse of power and information still exists.^[2]

It is in this sense that a government‚Äôs effort to collect and act on citizens‚Äô data fails us.

A potential compromise may be more insistent oversight of data-collection and security by an elected group of people.  In October, 2013, US Congressman Alan Grayson published a piece in The Guardian, sharing his experiences with the NSA evading oversight, evening going on to say he ‚Äúlearned far more about government spying on citizens from the media than I have from official intelligence briefings.‚Äù^[3]

It is clear that, at least with the current state of affairs, the supposed control our elected officials have over how our own data is used against us is weak at best.

You bring up a really good point. There is already existing oversight (supposedly) that is going ignored. The government agencies and large corporations that are the subject of these find ways to skirt oversight. 

The FBI and NSA's equivalent of the 5th amendment is ""we can't discuss an ongoing matter"" or ""it's POSSIBLY a security risk"" to even share information behind closed doors to elected members of congress.

In Defense of People‚Äôs Park,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/m3vabm/in_defense_of_peoples_park/,2021-03-12 16:37:17,"HISTORY

BEGINNINGS: 

On April 20th, 1969, People‚Äôs Park was born out of a derelict plot of land the UC had failed to develop into athletic fields. Cal students ‚Äî like you and me ‚Äî saw an opportunity to transform the unused land into a new community space. The creation of People‚Äôs Park was part of an effort to improve the neighborhood by addressing urban blight and to create a new free speech area distinct from the hotly-contested and police-regulated Sproul Plaza. 

As the park formed, thousands of different people donated food, equipment, trees, flowers, shrubs, and their own labor. A garden, playground, and meadow were constructed out of dirt and rubble. People‚Äôs Park became a place where students and residents of all stripes banded together to create a unique public space from the ground up.

OPPOSITION: 

A major facet of California Governor Ronald Reagan‚Äôs 1966 campaign was to crack down on California‚Äôs ‚Äúliberal‚Äù public universities. He decried Berkeley as ""a haven for communist sympathizers, protesters, and sex deviants‚Äù and saw the creation of the park as an opportunity to exercise his power and political might. Reagan ordered the California Highway Patrol and Berkeley Police to occupy and destroy the park, decimating much of what was constructed. A fence was built to prevent any further community development of ‚Äúuniversity-owned land.‚Äù  

On May 15, 1969 up to 4,000 students rallied to protect the park. The police responded with tear gas and violence, as they had routinely done throughout the ‚Äò60s in order to suppress anti-war and civil rights protests. Under the supervision of Reagan's Chief of Staff, Edwin Mease III ‚Äî a man who prided himself on crushing protestors ‚Äî police were permitted to use ‚Äúwhatever methods they chose.‚Äù Officers obscured their badges (to avoid being identified) as the number of protestors rose to over 6,000. 

As protestors fled from the violence, police opened fire with shotguns into the retreating crowd. Students watched as their friends were gunned down alongside them. Student Alan Blanchard was permanently blinded when he was shot in the head. Freshman Donavan Rundle recalled his intestines being ‚Äútucked back inside his body‚Äù by classmates as he bled out on the sidewalk. Blanchard, Rundle and 38 others were treated at local hospitals for shotgun wounds, with hundreds more seeking medical care for other grave injuries. Many more were seriously injured and avoided treatment out of fear of arrest. 

One bystander, James Rector, was shot and killed by cops while watching the police violence from the roof of a nearby building. He was twenty-five years old.

MILITARY OCCUPATION OF BERKELEY: 

In light of the mass violence against unarmed protestors, Governor Reagan stated ""once the dogs of war have been unleashed, you must expect things will happen, and that people, being human, will make mistakes on both sides."" He subsequently called in the National Guard to occupy and patrol Berkeley and prevent any further pro-Park activity.

National Guard troops broke up any assemblies of more than four people who congregated for any purpose on the streets of Berkeley, day or night. In the early summer, troops deployed in downtown Berkeley surrounded several thousand protesters and bystanders, emptying businesses, restaurants, and retail outlets of their owners and customers, and arresting them en masse. A memorial service for James Rector was held on Sproul that was attended by thousands, leading to hundreds of arrests. National Guard troops were stationed in front of Berkeley's empty lots and ordered to prevent protesters from planting flowers, shrubs, or trees.

On May 20th, Reagan ordered helicopters to drop teargas on Sproul and Telegraph protestors. Winds dispersed the gas over the entire city, sending school children miles away to hospitals. The airborne deployment of tear gas had not yet been banned from warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention. In the words of Governor Reagan, ""If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement.""

VICTORY: 

Showing solidarity with students, 177 faculty members said that they were ""unwilling to teach until peace has been achieved by the removal of police and troops."" On May 23, the Berkeley faculty senate endorsed (642 to 95) a proposal by the College of Environmental Designs to have the park become the centerpiece of an experiment in community-generated design. In a separate university referendum, UC Berkeley students voted 12,719 to 2,175 in favor of keeping the park. International attention and outcry forced Reagan and the police to concede. 

THE PARK TODAY

CRIME:

Statistically, there is a high incidence of crime at People‚Äôs Park. The majority of this crime is drug use. Some of the people who spend time and live in the park suffer from addiction and mental health issues. As opposed to criminalizing these individuals, why not invest in more humane approaches? The destruction of the park will remove this ‚Äúeyesore‚Äù from the eyes of privileged students, but it will not address any of the underlying issues facing park residents. Gentrifying the park will also displace the dozens of people who reside in the park because they find it to be a safe and welcoming environment. Believe it or not, that‚Äôs why so many people choose to congregate there. Poverty is not a crime.

BREAKING DOWN ACTUAL CRIME STATISTICS: 

To those of you who are afraid of these people, why? How many students have actually been victims of crime in Berkeley? Let‚Äôs look at the recently-available 2019 crime statistics. 

In 2019, the Murder Rate in Berkeley was 0.01 per 100,000 people, 5x below the national average. The Assault rate was 1.76, well below the national average of 2.50 per 100,000. As for rape and sexual assault, abolishing Greek Life on campus (a necessary step to address Berkeley‚Äôs high rape and sexual assault rates) requires an entirely different analysis. 

Okay, so your chances of being a victim of a violent crime are very low. What about property crime? In 2019, Berkeley‚Äôs rate was 59.27 per 1,000 people. That makes Berkeley safer than neighboring Oakland and luxurious Miami Beach, Florida, as well as dozens of other major cities around the country. Berkeley‚Äôs property crime rate is on par with San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Orlando. 

Rhetoric of safety and instilling a fear of crime has been routinely used to demonize and destroy communities of poor people and people of color. We shouldn‚Äôt fall for this age-old fear campaign again. While crime in Berkeley went up in 2020, it also rose in every single major and mid-sized American city due to the pandemic. It‚Äôs a fact that Berkeley is not a very dangerous place. 

HOUSING:

UC Berkeley needs to build more housing, but the park is simply not the place. The Chancellor‚Äôs office is officially considering building housing on the Upper Hearst Parking Structure and the Oxford Tract, but has elected to proceed with the Park. In recent years, it chose to build the Legends Swimming Complex (because surely Cal needed a fifth swimming pool complex) and the Underhill Parking and Athletic Complex instead of providing more housing. The University has also stated that it has been increasing the number of admitted students disproportionate to the number of available beds. Under the current plan, the People‚Äôs Park housing site is expected to create a maximum of 1,000 beds, which would house at most 2% of students. 

A proactive solution would be for the University to stop actively admitting more students than it can support. Furthermore, the UC should start to combat restrictive and archaic City zoning laws that restrict the height of new buildings and specify development types. These outdated laws protect panoramic views of the Bay and hasten gentrification, while preventing the construction of more plentiful and affordable housing for residents and students alike. 

COMMUNITY:

The park is not an empty lot, but a vibrant community for our society‚Äôs most vulnerable members. People excluded from other spheres of public life congregate and maintain enduring friendships in the park. Displacing these residents would take away a core component of their daily lives and send the message that privileged students deserve to upend the lives of those they deem inferior in order to enjoy a more insular lifestyle.

SUMMARY:

People‚Äôs Park is an emblem of Berkeley‚Äôs history of radical, compassionate politics. Building on the park would not only destroy this icon along with the legacy it represents, but also destroy a real, existing community. Paving over a green space used by vulnerable community members would be a final nail in the coffin for any image of Berkeley as an equitable, public university, and cement its transformation into an institution for students from elite backgrounds to preserve their status without worrying about interacting with those they feel are beneath them. We chose to attend Berkeley to improve the world, not to lock ourselves up in the ivory tower, close our eyes, and bulldoze away any reminders of injustice.

You conveniently fail to mention the robbery statistic. Berkeley's 3.37 per 1000 is over 4 times the national average. Robbery is a very violent crime, in case you didn't know. That brings Berkeley's total crime rate to 586 per 100,000, or 59.8% higher than the national average. Why omit this statistic? 

>Okay, so your chances of being a victim of a violent crime are very low.

Compared to either the rest of the state or the nation, no.

No one is holding Oakland up as the pinnacle of public safety. Furthermore, since you apparently are quite the fan of cherry-picking, we are less safe, property crime-wise, than Baltimore, Chicago, and even Detriot.

Furthermore, this entire analysis is nonsense. We are debating People's park, not the city of Berkeley. You yourself note that People's Park has an incredibly elevated crime rate for such a small parcel of land. That is why it is dangerous.

Irrelevant. People's park should still be built on. Every bed built is a win.

I totally agree. People's park should still be built on. All of these things should occur simultaneously.

The rest of your argument is entirely rhetorical, so I won't bother.

 People's Park should be torn down. The new building that houses hundreds if not thousands will serve as a symbol that the purpose of the University is to educate people to think critically and act rationally, not become swept up in the rose-tinted nostalgia of an era that they never even experienced.
Very good job on this. I get booed for it."
