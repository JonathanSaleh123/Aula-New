Does anyone have any past exams for Engineering 120: Principles of Engineering Economics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bn1toe/does_anyone_have_any_past_exams_for_engineering/,2019-05-10 11:23:56,"This is specifically for exams by Eric Friedman. I have the Fall 2017 paper but I'm looking to get more practice and would appreciate if someone could send me any other past exams.

TBP only has midterms. 

Thanks!","I was in Friedman's class last semester.  We never got our finals back nor a final score.  We took the final and then the the final class grade was published to calcentral.

Please don't ask me what was on the final, I only needed a passing grade in the class to graduate and aimed for a 10%+ so I don't remember anything on it
