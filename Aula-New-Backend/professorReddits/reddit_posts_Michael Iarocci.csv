I am a freshman and need to drop one of those classes. I have all online classes (the only one that isn’t online is Spanish) and I am undeclared in the College of L&S. I am also taking a business and math class so would like help from anyone who knows the workload, professors, etc for these classes. 

Help is much appreciated and needed!!","Nutrition
I loved 133A so I'd recommend keeping it! Rosenthal is great"
