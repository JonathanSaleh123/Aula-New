"How copper could help combat obesity: A study led by Chris Chang, a UC Berkeley chemistry professor and faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab's Chemical Sciences Division, has found that copper plays a key role in metabolizing fat. ""The more copper there is, the more the fat is broken down.""",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3630204/How-COPPER-help-combat-obesity-Essential-nutrient-plays-key-role-breaking-fat-cells.html,2016-06-08 21:43:32,,"

Copper is expensive as hell. A guy here at people's park used to go into abandoned houses and buildings in Detroit and strip them of all the copper. He made a lot of money till he got caught and now he's hiding out for a bit here. I always got an eye on him in case he try and steal my stuff. Once a robber always a robber. I don't steal unless I'm starving. One time I was looking for a bedroom to rent when I first move here to Berkeley and I asked if I could use the bathroom and I snagged a couple bars of soap, a tooth brush and some TP, and a washcloth. So if ur ever running low just go to a open house and ask to use the bathroom. I started doing this all the time. I told my best bud Harry, who is an idiot, about m this and so he try to do it to but you can't steal couch cushions and liquor bottles from a open house especially when you don't shower for a month. He's got a lot to learn and I don't have the patience to teach him. Plus he never listens. I tried teaching him how to take a dump standing up so he could be more discreet at the bus stops, but instead he would always fall backwards and get crap on himself. Idiot
All this does is further the body shaming that is so pervasive today. They really need to stop studying obesity as if it's a disease.
It is a disease according to the American Medical Association. Which is the US body tasked with deciding what qualifies as a disease."

&#x200B;

I.

&#x200B;

""c4,"" Chris's voice crackled through the phone, a disruptive echo in the peaceful hum of Caffe Strada. Jack shot a glance at the barista, hoping she hadn't overheard the cryptic chess move. His half-finished latte felt lukewarm in his hand.

&#x200B;

""Hold on,"" Jack frowned, pulling the phone back from his ear. ""Hold on a second, Chris. Did you just c4 me without even getting through my spam queue?"" He glanced at the screen - sixteen unread notifications blinked back, a testament to his digital hermitage.

&#x200B;

A dry chuckle crackled back. ""Squirrel, always gotta prioritize, right? Besides, seven is our number, remember? Can't let tradition wait its turn in some digital purgatory.""

&#x200B;

Jack's lips twisted in a nostalgic smile. Seven. Their lucky number from childhood chess battles, scribbled on the underside of desks and etched into the worn wood of their shared backyard table. But that was years ago, before Chris had vanished into the MIT vortex, emerging five years later with a few degrees and an MBA, and tracked him down on Reddit.

&#x200B;

""Fine,"" Jack conceded, relishing the familiar banter. ""But next time, let the plebeians have their say before the king makes his move."" He tapped the screen, silencing the notification storm and finally answered Chris's call. ""So, what's this grand game you're dragging me into, Mr. Startup Mogul?""

&#x200B;

Chris's voice hummed with an energy that hadn't quite dimmed over the years. ""Let's call it Silicon Valley chess, Squirrel. A startup, my brainchild, and a chance to put those inquisitive eyes of yours to work on something that might actually change the world, just like my mentor always said.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

II.

&#x200B;

""Hold on, hold on,"" Jack muttered, pulling the phone away. ""Chris, can you hold your horses for a sec? I'm, uh, in the middle of something vital."" He peeked through the cafe window, searching for a hint of auburn hair, a splash of vibrant pink scarf.

&#x200B;

""Vital?"" Chris scoffed, the amusement evident in his voice. ""More like vitalizing your caffeine levels. But fine, Squirrel, enlighten me. What could possibly be more important than a game-changing startup discussion with your old pal?""

&#x200B;

Jack hesitated. Should he confess his newfound passion for brewing the perfect cup of milk tea, meticulously analyzing sugar ratios and bubble textures? The image of Mei's bright smile as she judged his latest ""Sunrise Mango Madness"" creation flashed in his mind. ""Uh, let's just say,"" he started, ""I'm currently engaged in a delicate experiment, a quest for liquid enlightenment. And let me tell you, Chris, the stakes are high.""

&#x200B;

Chris snorted, amusement crackling through the line. ""Liquid enlightenment? You've gone full-on Berkeley hippy, Squirrel? Trading data graphs for dharma circles and tie-dye algorithms?""

&#x200B;

Jack grinned. ""Hey, don't knock the tie-dye algorithms,"" he countered. ""This boba brewing I'm into, it's like alchemy, man. Sugar ratios, bubble dynamics, it's a whole universe waiting to be optimized. And let's be honest, my last dance with the CS clubs wasn't exactly Woodstock.""

&#x200B;

A brief silence followed, then Chris chuckled. ""Algorithm rejection? That the official term? Squirrel, you got tossed out of every club faster than a boba straw from a compost bin. Trust me, your boba brewing is a step up.""

&#x200B;

Jack laughed, the bitterness of the rejection fading under Chris's playful jab. ""Precisely! They couldn't handle my unorthodox methods, my insistence on analyzing bubble buoyancy and optimizing tapioca texture. But you know what? This isn't just some sugary drink, Chris. It's an art form, a science, a… culinary chess match against my taste buds. And right now, I'm on the cusp of a breakthrough.""

&#x200B;

""Alright, alright,"" Chris conceded, his voice laced with genuine understanding. ""You finish your 'tea-fu training,' then we talk 'Silicon Valley chess.' But just remember, Squirrel, my revolution might just involve the world's most mind-blowing boba algorithm. Your move.""","U okay bud?
Busy. u?"

XII.

The post-game dinner was a blur of clinking glasses, congratulations, and Nick basking in the afterglow of a successful deal. Jack, however, felt a disquietude settle in his stomach. The memory of Crystal's eyes, watching him from behind the cypress trees, played on repeat in his mind. It was a forgotten promise, a whisper from a different life, yet it stirred a restlessness he couldn't ignore.

Back in his resort room, the glow of his iPad cast an accusatory light on the desk. His mind, usually a well-oiled machine when it came to academics, was a tangled mess. Images of Mei, back in Berkeley, flickered alongside memories of Crystal's shy smile. The guilt gnawed at him, a constant reminder of the promise made on a warm Californian breeze years ago.

He swiped through the dense PDF text on his iPad, forcing himself to focus, but the words swam before his eyes. The urge to see Crystal, to fulfill that forgotten vow, became an overwhelming tide. Finally, with a frustrated sigh, he shut down the tablet.

A quick text to Chris, a flimsy excuse about needing some fresh air, and Jack was out the door. He borrowed Chris' SUV, a behemoth he wasn't entirely comfortable driving, and set off based on hazy memories.

Navigating the winding coastal roads under the cloak of night was an adventure in itself, the headlights cutting through the darkness like hesitant fingers. After what felt like an eternity, a flicker of recognition sparked in his mind. There, nestled amongst the trees, was the white house with the blue porch swing he vaguely remembered. His heart hammered in his chest, a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. He pulled the SUV to a stop on the shoulder of the road, its engine ticking a nervous beat in the stillness of the night.

XIII.

Jack's shadow stretched long and distorted on the manicured lawn as he neared the mansion. The air hung heavy with the weight of his decision, each step echoing his internal debate.

Should he turn back? Should he just forget this entire detour and focus on his looming midterms and the life he'd built back in Berkeley? But then, a flicker of movement from within the house snagged his attention.

Lights, soft and golden, bloomed in a window off to the side. It was the study, a room he remembered filled with overstuffed armchairs and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Pretty soon, a melody drifted from within the house.

The music, both familiar and strangely different, sent a jolt through him. It was the opening strains of Dvořák's ""8 Humoresques, Op. 101, B. 187 - [No. 7 Poco Lento e grazioso](https://youtu.be/GgK_3GRWzII)"", but not the piano version he knew well. This melody soared with the delicate cry of a violin, its notes laced with a poignant sweetness that tugged at his heartstrings. It wasn't Crystal's favorite – that was the piano piece. This arrangement by Fritz Kreisler, with its intricate flourishes, was something else entirely. It was the piece his mother had been playing the night she met his father, a story he'd shared with Crystal years ago on a sun-drenched California beach.

His breath hitched. There was no mistaking it. Crystal was there, playing the very same piece that had unknowingly become a thread woven into the tapestry of their past. A conflicting wave of emotions flooded him – surprise, a pang of guilt for forgetting the story, and a tremor of hope that warmed him from the inside out. Did she remember? Did she play it deliberately, a silent message carried on the wings of a violin?

He stood frozen, his hand hovering in mid-air, inches from the grand oak door. The music continued, its gentle melody weaving through the night air, a silent invitation or perhaps a question mark echoing in the darkness. Jack knew then, with a certainty that surprised even him, that he couldn't turn back. He had to know. He had to face her, face the past, and whatever awaited him on the other side of that door.

XIV.

The melody swelled to a final flourish, then faded into silence, leaving a poignant echo in the night air.

Suddenly, the heavy oak door creaked open, not a hesitant sliver this time, but with a deliberate swing. Anna, Crystal's older sister, stood framed in the doorway, a hint of amusement dancing in her eyes.

""Jack,"" she declared, her voice warm and knowing. ""There you are. Chris called to say you were getting some fresh air, but it seems you got a little lost.""

Jack's heart thumped a surprised rhythm against his ribs. Chris? He hadn't told Chris where he was going, just a flimsy excuse about needing a break. A blush crept up his neck as he stammered, ""Uh, yeah, I... just needed to clear my head a bit.""

Anna's smile widened. ""Well, it seems you've found your way. Crystal's been expecting you.""

Her words hung in the air, heavy with implication. Jack's gaze darted past Anna, landing on the figure bathed in the warm glow of the study's doorway. Crystal stood there, a violin case resting at her feet, a look of anticipation and a hint of nervousness etched on her beautiful face.

The years had changed her. Gone was the youthful exuberance of their past, replaced by a quiet grace and a maturity reflected in her deeper-set eyes. Yet, the smile that lit up her face as their eyes met was undeniably hers. It held a warmth that transcended time, a silent recognition of their shared history and the forgotten vow that had drawn him there.

""Jack,"" she whispered, her voice husky with emotion. The room seemed to shrink, the world outside fading away as their gazes locked. There, in the hushed quiet of the study, the weight of years seemed to melt away, leaving only the raw vulnerability of a long-awaited reunion and a future waiting to be written, perhaps.

XV.

The air crackled with unspoken emotions as they stood there, eyes locked in a silent conversation that spanned years. Finally, Jack managed a shaky smile. ""So,"" he started, his voice rough with disuse, ""where are you headed off to for school this year?""

""Funny you should ask,"" Crystal said, her voice a warm melody. ""Mom was pushing for this 'farm' out near Palo Alto, something about a family legacy. But honestly, I think I'd rather be a hunter.""

Jack's heart skipped a beat. ""A hunter?""

""Yeah, hunting some ... bears, maybe."" She shrugged, then almost imperceptibly, her eyes darted past Jack's shoulder, lingering for a beat on the wall behind him.  He followed her gaze, his breath catching in his throat.  There, framed and mounted with obvious pride, hung a vintage sports poster. The headline screamed: ""Jack Nicklaus, the Golden Bear!""  It was a younger Jack, a champion golfer in his prime, holding aloft a gleaming trophy.

Jack's smile faltered, a knot of confusion tightening in his gut. He didn't know what to say, caught between the joy of their reunion and the unexpected weight of the past hanging heavy in the air.

XVI.

The cold, polished tile floor of the opulent hotel room sent a sterile chill through Jack with every step. Outside, the city lights twinkled indifferently, a far cry from the warmth of the reunion he'd just experienced.  His mind, usually a laser focused on academics, was a churning sea of emotions. Crystal's playful banter, the lingering touch of her hand – they echoed in his memory like the haunting call of a lone gull.

He slumped back into his sleek mahogany chair, the California breeze he craved replaced by the sterile hum of air conditioning. Notebooks lay scattered across the desk, their contents as foreign as a pirate's treasure map.  He felt adrift, caught between the upcoming C161B midterm-1 and the unexpected storm Crystal's presence had stirred within him.

A knock on the door startled him from his reverie. Chris entered, a playful glint in his eyes and a tray laden with snacks and spring water in his hands. ""Hey buddy, heard you went for a late-night birdie hunt. Bag anything interesting?"" he asked, a mischievous grin spreading across his face.

Jack winced. Chris's well-meaning phone call had thrown a wrench into his carefully constructed plan for a solo visit. Now, the weight of his secret detour, coupled with the looming exam, formed a knot of tension in his gut. ""Just needed some fresh air,"" he mumbled, avoiding Chris's gaze.

Chris raised an eyebrow, clearly not buying it. ""Uh-huh,"" he said, setting the tray down on the desk. ""Fresh air that just happened to lead you to Crystal's mansion, right?""

Jack sighed, defeated. There was no point in lying to Chris.  ""Yeah, okay,"" he admitted, a mix of frustration and reluctant respect for his friend's perceptiveness coloring his voice. ""Look, I know you probably think I should reconnect with Crystal, but—""

Chris cut him off with a placating hand. ""Whoa, whoa, slow down there,"" he said, his voice gentle. ""Never said anything about who you should reconnect with, Jack. Just figured you might want to face whatever's been bugging you lately, be it a forgotten vow or a looming exam."" He eyed the scattered notebooks.  ""Speaking of challenges, that's quite the load you've got there.  You sure you're not trying to prove something?""

Jack met his gaze, a flicker of defiance in his eyes.  ""Maybe,"" he said. ""Maybe Dad could have aced four tech courses at Berkeley, juggling golf on the side, but that's not me.  This is about pushing myself, honoring his memory in my own way.""  A shadow of doubt crossed his face.  ""Sometimes I feel like he..."" His voice trailed off, a heavy silence settling in the room, laden with a suspicion he couldn't quite voice.

Chris chuckled, the sound warm and genuine.  ""Like he favored me because I aced MIT?  Come on, Jack. Your dad loved you.  He told me once, after a particularly brutal round of golf, that you had the biggest heart of anyone he knew.  He was incredibly proud of you, even if you didn't follow in his footsteps exactly.""

Jack snorted.  ""Proud of me for chasing girls instead of GPAs, you mean?""

Chris grinned. ""Maybe a little,"" he admitted.  ""But hey, that's part of your charm.  You wouldn't be you without it. Besides, who wouldn't want to be Jack?  You've got the brains, the looks, and the ability to light up a room wherever you go.""

Jack couldn't help but smile at that, a flicker of his old confidence returning.  Maybe Chris was right.  Maybe this crazy course load, this unexpected detour, it was all part of finding his own path, honoring his father in his own way.  And maybe, just maybe, there was still room in his life for a little human connection, Crystal or otherwise.  ""Thanks, Chris,"" he said, a hint of gratitude in his voice.  ""You always know how to lighten the mood.""

""That's what friends are for,"" Chris said, clapping him on the shoulder.  ""Now, how about we open one of these textbooks on your iPad and see if we can't turn this birdie hunt into an academic eagle?""",

**Original Post from Chris Hunn:**
> **Change to course retake rules for the L&S CS major GPA threshold**
> 
> In light of the high demand for EECS courses and the CS major, the faculty are considering a proposal that revises our major admissions policy to discourage CS-intended students from intentionally failing lower-division courses. This practice delays student progress, increases enrollment in lower-division courses, and can lead students to make decisions that they later regret. Lower-division courses required for the major should be taken for a letter grade, and students who intend to major in CS should endeavor to pass. The proposed policy change encourages CS-intended students to do so.

Considering that last semester there were 1600 people in CS61A, the demand for CS is at an all time high. We don't have nearly as much funding for that many students. 
Good
I think they should then also allow you to take it again without failing and have it count towards your GPA. ie. You get a B- the first time but you needed a B so you have to take it again and get a B+ this time. 
How in the word did they manage that organizationally? When I graduated we had something like 700 in 61A and Wheeler was maxed out.
This would make the overcrowding in 61a unbearable, and impossible to support. We already need to rely on Google to have this class, we can't have it be even worse.

I know everyone wants ideally that you should have a second chance if you don't do well, but that isn't the reality. These policies are designed to limit enrollment, and not because they need to have a 3.3 level of understanding to take further classes. Beyond that, this is against university policy which the Cs dept cannot change.
They moved it to Zellerbach... :\
Then they should honestly make it not related to your GPA. Just have CS majors declare upon applying to the university like those of us in Engineering had to do. It's just seems silly that they have to go through all of this just to limit enrollment. 
Only for the first lecture. It was in Pauley the rest of the semester, because students just went for the webcasts instead.
Why? If it's well advertised and changes only affect new students people can choose to apply to eecs or not. Now who is able to do CS is based upon real success in CS classes at college, not whatever arbitrary criteria and randomness gets through the college admissions process, which is meant to try and determine who would be successful at college, exactly what the GPA limit tests.

Additionally, the CS department cannot make that change the way people are declared into LS, and this would be a huge change, but the CS dept can be really on top of changing declaration process, and while this is a problem now it likely won't always be. After the dot com bubble the CS dept was quickly able to remove the GPA cap which was then 3.5.

So the solution is still to watch as more and more students attempt to declare CS, can't meet the criteria and are either forced to transfer or choose a major that they don't prefer. Just feels like the students who don't meet the GPA requirement are getting shafted even though they may not be bad at CS or unworthy of obtaining a degree. 
The alternative is that the same amount of people will get shafted by being rejected. I know everyone only focuses on the negatives here because no one who makes the gpa cut off complains about it, but as a LSCS major who did not apply as a CS major, I think it's good that the people who perform the best in actual CS classes are able to do CS, not just those that applied to do it. While I don't think those with lower gpa than me are ""bad"" at CS and certainly not unworthy, the reality is the CS dept cannot accommodate everyone, and I believe those with a track record of success in CS classes at Berkeley is the best way to determine who should be prioritized. Where I would have a problem is a more arbitrary system like haas or college applications where there is more uncertainty around how likely you are to get in. Here there is a firm line in the sand drawn, and everyone is made aware of it beforehand, and then you can choose with that information to go here or not, because at the end of the day no one is making people come here.

Yes it is unfortunate that people who have decided to go here are unable to do CS, but this is made clear to people that this can and will happen, and need to plan accordingly. I know people who have not made the cutoff and done CogSci, applied math with concentrations in CS, physics, biology and other things and have been just fine down the road.
That's not the answer. Actually, your solution is a bit elitist. The real answer is to make sure the CS department has sufficient funding to accept everyone who can graduate in CS with a 2.0 GPA. If this means funding needs to be cut elsewhere such as athletics or a department with few students and little research, that difficult decision needs to be made. I don't want xyz department saved while students get screwed over with that 3.3 GPA cutoff. That being said, I agree that something had to be done about folks who failed CS classes deliberately.

Imagine how many more students would apply to CS if it was guaranteed with a 2.0 prereq GPA. And how many people in cogsci or math didn't really want those majors?

> If you find funds for two additional full time staff to process individual manual enrollments, we would be happy to do that.  Alternately, campus could obtain or design a functional enrollment system.

I don't think this particular role is an example of administrative bloat. CS 370 has traditionally been taught by undergraduates, so having some permanence there is a plus. Additionally, the hiring system for large CS classes desperately needs work. It is very hard matching up hundreds of applicants' lab assisting history from other classes + teaching history, so having a global database with this kind of information is extremely valuable. 61B has hired TAs off of interviews this coming semester, and just filtering for interview candidates took *so* much time.
The lab also funds research into scaling CS education. This lab produced http://okpy.org/"

## **Student's Piazza post**

> **Advice for dropping out of college as an EECS major**
> 
> Not sure if there are any previous posts regarding this so I decided to make my own. My circumstances right now:
> 
> - I am a first-year transfer majoring in EECS
> 
> - This is my second semester and I have taken or am taking CS61A, B, and C, 70, and EE16A
> 
> - I am a full-time student also working two part-time jobs and the ocassional freelance work
> 
> - I am from a very low-income family and I am the main source of income
> 
> My source of stress and the reason why I am considering this at all is because of the last point listed above. I currently receive full financial aid for my classes (besides the summer semester, for some reason) and the extra money I get from grants/loans along with the money from working is crucial to my family's survival. Forgive me if it sounds like I'm dramatizing that, but I can't really think of a better way to put it.
> 
> This May, I will not have enough money to support my family lest we resort to living in a shelter or cramped apartment. Even then, we would not have enough money for a lot of the necessities we pay for every month. The only options I can think of are to drop out/take a semester off or attend school part-time, all in order to have time for a full-time job as a software engineer. I believe I have the necessary experience and side projects already for landing such a job, but naturally I'm afraid to just drop out. The problem with taking a semester off or attending part-time is that, since I'm a transfer in the engineering department, I believe I only have a limited number of semesters here before I can no longer enroll. I suppose I could petition to stay longer as another option, though.
> 
> In summary, I'm considering dropping out to support my family before we go homeless. If I have the experience and confidence in my skills to land a software engineering job right now, should I go for it? Some clarification for how long an EECS transfer can attend would also be appreciated.

You seem like a very resilient person, and after all the tribulations life has thrown at you, I am sure finding an internship will be no problem. Given how well internships pay, you can both take care of your family and not drop out of school.
> 
> Please hang in there. You can do it. Just one more year to go, then you can find a comfortable full time software engineering job with your Berkeley degree without any problems. College, and especially the world's best colleges like Berkeley, lift their graduates out of poverty into the middle class. You won't need to worry about finances any more then. You're so close. Don't give up.

The OP wrote:

A student wrote:

> EECS transfer here. I think you have five semesters in total, and I heard you can postpone graduating if you do a co-op or full-time internship. Please talk to your ESS advisor as they know the stuff best! Besides, there are a lot of resources to support transfers. Talk to Tiffany Reardon at ESS! All the best. 

The OP wrote:

> After freshman year, I ""dropped out"" of Berkeley CoE. Then I worked as a software engineer and was making ~$50/hour. Then I decided to go back to school after 2 years. Afterwards, I still had an offer to work part time but I decided to focus on school. Like you, I also had 0 EFC.

> Hypothetically, if you work part time for 20 hours a week and $30/hour, you'd be making $2500 pre tax which would be good enough to cover your family expenses if you keep things budgeted. Also do keep in mind that the more money you make, the more taxes you pay so working 40 hours a week may not necessarily give you twice as much as if you had worked 20 hours a week. Working part time will probably affect your GPA but I think thats a compromise you would have to make. Also, having an internship over the summer can get you like $15k over the course of the summer which might be enough to barely scrape by.

> One reason for my coming back to school is that I would be able to make more money after I graduate. I'd suggest that you try to find a way to make ends meet and graduate soon so that you can get a full job.

Contrary to what people may say, it may also be a good idea to go into debt. This is a view that I have that not many people agree with, but in my situation, I made a calculated risk to go into (0% interest) debt in order to have more emergency cash padding. If you want to take a gamble that you will be able to find a good six figure job after you graduate, consider going into debt. $1 today is as valuable as $0.20 in a few years.

> (As a side story, my mom passed away within the past year meaning i am no longer eligible for the 0 EFC next year and my income counts against me. However, I can submit a appeal for student contribution. Also, you can get a appeal for budget adjustment to get more financial aid.)

> Feel free to ask any questions about my own experience

The OP wrote:

> Thank you for sharing this. Could you clarify what you mean by going into debt? I'm already taking out federal loans and, aside from borrowing from people I personally know, I don't see how private loans would have 0% interest. My initial plan was to rely on my federal grants/loans and I was fairly confident I could land a decent job right after graduating to pay them off asap, but my circumstances have changed such that I now would need to take out more loans to go down that same route (something I consider riskier than just trying to find a job now and finishing school later).

A student wrote:

> (I'm the author of the initial response thread). By going into debt, I mean using it to make ends meet while you work towards graduating. My situation was probably different from yours in that I had built up a credit score and was eligible to apply for credit cards that gave 0% interest for 15-21 months. This allowed me to get access to about $20k in 0% interest (of course, I didn't use it all but it was something useful to have to pay for important expenses that financial aid didn't cover). Having a full time job also helped my chances of getting a credit card.
> 
> One plan that could work for you is taking one year off of school to work as a software developer. Then while you're there, save enough to help you get through for the next two years. And perhaps, if your credit score is okay, then you could even get 0% interest credit cards. With 15-21 months of no interest (Citi Simplicity; Chase Slate; Discover 18 months), you will be able to focus on school while also being able to survive. Then you will have only paid a few months of interest before you get a job hopefully making a decent salary.

> Oh, I think i'm writing in circles, but I hope this clarified things without making things more  confusing. Feel free to ask more questions.

A student commented:

> I'm the author of the initial response thread). Oh, one more clarification I have to make. My decision to open these credit cards were carefully planned and I had written up a detailed plan on how I was going to manage the money. If done haphazardly, credit cards could be cause more problems than it solves.

A student commented:

> I just wanted to say that I wish you the best of luck with your situation. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to follow the EECS curriculum while supporting your family. All I know is that you must be extremely capable, smart, and hardworking if you've made it this far, and I'm sure that will help you a lot in your professional future. Keep going, you've made it so far!

A student commented:

> Are you white or Asian? If so, you're already privileged so this situation shouldn't be a problem. Just use your privilege!

A student commented:

> are you serious? No point to be a troll under this post

A student commented:

> Not a troll. Whites and Asians are privileged. They don't need help. Only minorities, LGBQT, etc. are victims. 

A student commented:

> Glad this page is not totally anonymous so at least staff members could know who this ridiculous person is ;)

A student commented:

> Let's please not make jokes here. This person (and the commmenter above) is revealing some highly personal information, and we should be mature about it. I, too, am not a fan of political correctness but this is the wrong forum to attack political correctness.

A student commented:

> I think it's relevant though. I have a slight feeling that the OP is Asian. He/she should know how the left views them: as overprivileged, monotonous automatons.

A student commented:

> What does this have to do with anything? OP is just asking for advice, and not once mentioned privilege or anything like that.

A student commented:

> Not sure how you assumed the OP was Asian. Also, it may be true the left views Asians and whites in the way you described. In fact, many posters in the ""Town halls too politically correct"" expressed that view. So that may be correct. However, by bringing this up, you're using the OP's plight to make a political point, which is not related to the discussion at all.

A student commented:

> At the risk of getting dragged into a fruitless debate, perhaps we should be mindful of the fact that everybody's personal situation and experiences are different. Trying to stereotype people, assign characteristics to arbitrary groups of people, and otherwise deny people their individual identities, thoughts, and feelings is unhelpful and harmful. This is regardless of whether it's done for comedic effect, to make a political point, or whether it stereotypes ""whites"", ""asians"", ""the left"", ""the right"", ""LGBQT people"".

A student commented:

> Asians aren't a monolithic group, either. Some groups are overall underprivileged, like southeast Asians.

An instructor replied:

> Why is this relevant or helpful? Please, try to be sensitive. This should be a supportive space; please try to be helpful and kind. The admins can see your names and we will not tolerate trolling.

I think OP is right, he should take a semester off and try to come back later. State of well-being comes first before studies, if you don't have your welfare taken care of before your studies, it will disturb your ability to study well. Definitely find out and petition the administration for extra semesters, meanwhile try to save as much as you can and try to find work. I don't know much about software job industry, but it's going to be tough. There wont be any guarantee finding a job but nevertheless do not give up and try to keep the work you already have. I do not recommend resorting to a shelter because from my experience the list to get in is very long and the environment is bit dangerous. Do not be discouraged from moving your family into a smaller apartment, people can definitely find ways to handle it. I am guessing OP's family don't work because they're immigrants or because of health issues. Nevertheless OP can try to save by getting handouts from food banks and churches, applying for programs like food stamps, getting discounts on utilities, and using public transit. 

TL;DR Don't be afraid to drop out and go for that software engineering job.
I don't want to identify myself otherwise I would post on the Piazza, but if the poster is from the greater Richmond area (and fucked up as this is, is Asian and is first or 1.5 gen) I might be able to give him some hook-ups for loans of up to ~$5k/semester at no interest until graduation.

(I'm also a transfer from a low-income family who needs to supplement household income. I quit my 30hr job and now I'm only working 15hr which is WAY more manageable)
Sigh at the one anon bringing in race into this smh
Take out loans rather than drop out imo. Graduating in several years with an EECS degree will more than pay for itself. 
We would have had free college with Bernie but we got a Drumpf instead. I'm so sorry about your situation. Please do set up a GoFundMe, and I will donate to it - it is the progressive thing to do while we are stuck in the dark ages with Drumpf.
if living in an apartment with your family is worst case scenario, it sounds like your family is living beyond its means. Have fewer kids next time?
Why does it matter if he is asian or not?
Financial aid for independent students covers tuition as well as housing. So college is basically free. Supporting a family on the other hand...
Any family is one diagnosis or cat accident away from this, potentially. Don't be such an asshole. 
You have no idea what you are talking about. You don't even understand the scenario described in the OP. 
tfw when you're too retarded to get into a decent uni and blame everything on affirmative action
Because that is how most Asians at Cal are- exclusive as fuck.
