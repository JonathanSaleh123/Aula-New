Hi folks, 

I'm going to post once on this thread, and will very likely not reply, so fair warning. I am speaking personally, and not on behalf of the EECS department. 

I don't have any insight, but **this is not acceptable. I and many colleagues do not consider this, nor many of the other comments on that thread acceptable.** We have already shared this with department leadership.

**All students are able to submit climate reports at** [**https://eecs.link/climate**](https://eecs.link/climate) \-- whether is it a faculty concern, student concerns, etc. Please consider filling out a report. 

If you want to discuss with faculty please consider emailing directly. I will be at a conference this well, but you can email me and I will do my best to reply. 

Thanks folks in advance for being polite and considerate when discussing things.
I feel so bad for every girl taking this class bc wtf do you mean your professor is saying ""the behavior of women"" where you live is bad??? What behavior?? Actually insane comment.
The speed at which this circulated in my gcs is insane
That is‚Ä¶ incredibly strange.
I‚Äôm liking 189 so far, I like Shewchuck‚Äôs lectures, but I find him so incredibly annoying and a horrible influence for the students he teaches, particularly CS guys.

Imo this ain‚Äôt even the first time he said some out of pocket shit, earlier in the semester he publicly expressed frustration that DS majors were enrolled in the course ahead of CS majors on Ed. That‚Äôs fine and good to feel that way except you have those same DS majors reading that they don‚Äôt belong in the class, and lots of those CS dudes fostering resentment.

Literally one of the first things someone posted on the midterm thread yesterday was implying that students didn‚Äôt deserve to be in the course by virtue of their midterm scores cause of the waitlist, imo inspired by Shewchuck‚Äôs earlier statements.

And this new shit is so demeaning again to a significant portion of his class, and incredibly blatantly misogynistic lol. And you have students who like him and so ask him to elaborate on Ed? Are we for real? And his defenders in these comments saying some fucked up shit too? 

He‚Äôs a great explainer of concepts imo and obviously a crazy smart guy, but the EQ side of his teaching has irked me this semester, idk if it‚Äôs always like this.

I‚Äôm fired up because CS is a great subject with often elitist, sexist people, and as a teacher you should try and push the subject away from these stereotypes, but dude is basically fostering incels in a classroom forum. 

Plus, hey maybe the reason you can‚Äôt get a girl in the bay is because you look down on them for some reason lol, not cause of their ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù
Post the whole thread‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs not gonna redeem him but it is funny.
Some random dude from usc just texted me about this üòÇüòÇüòÇ

What exactly is he trying to say? I can't really parse it.

Is he claiming that because the Bay Area has less women demographically, the ""behavior"" of women will tend to be more... picky?
‚Ä¶I mean this is coming from the guy who bought his wife from a poor Asian country

Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at his Facebook
What is tenure for if not to say unpopular things?
They locked the thread on Ed :(
This whole thread is really uncomfortable to read ‚Ä¶
The midterm got everyone to lose their mind huh?
Looks like he ‚Äògot‚Äô his wife from somewhere VERY far from the Bay Area
female students taking this class - have you had any negative interactions with him where he was sexist?
‚ÄúI identify as a Smith & Wesson 460XVR .45 caliber revolver. (death/deathem/deathself.)‚Äù

This is from Prof Shewchuck‚Äôs website as well. Seems like an awful and transphobic ‚Äújoke‚Äù meant to mock transgender students.
I'm sure his female colleagues appreciate this-- you know, all 4 in CS.
LMAOO
Maybe the real reason is because everyone here is Gay
what a fucking loser prof
Sounds like someone who was constantly rejected and developed a hatred for women because he didn‚Äôt have his way. 

I was born and raised in the bay and have never had a problem with finding a girlfriend. 
It‚Äôs about being a part of a social circle with people who have common interests and also being a person with depth and not so superficial as to think your academic or financial accomplishments entitle you to female attention. 

Being a passport bro is pretty much a confession that you aren‚Äôt able to attract any women in your own demographic and have to use your first world privilege to attract women who are looking for financial support and a better quality of life.
This guy should not be a professor
I‚Äôve heard this perspective about the Bay Area from men, but the only types of men it‚Äôs been coming from is those who are strange or defective in someway
CS 189 moment
Lame ass post he needs to grow up. Please no one ask him thot daughter or gay son.

Did anyone report this to the school?
[deleted]
This is an extremely biased and personal opinion that would actually motivate the OP negatively. This school is hard especially if you are a cs/eecs guy taking classes like 189. You grind for hours and hours straight to impress employers or researchers so that you can work more. There is value in that, that‚Äôs how innovation happens and we all know Berkeley is a leading institution in that regard. However, when you put this many motivated people together and make these courses as hard as they are (126, 127, 189 and etc) and if you succeed, you look around and see people having fun that you can‚Äôt have although by academic and societal standards you succeeded. You feel like you deserve to have fun but you can‚Äôt because you haven‚Äôt worked that muscle for years. You find yourself in a void that you think you can‚Äôt escape, your self esteem is on the floor because of all the competition and rejections. This is only a state of mind that this school puts you in. But if you don‚Äôt realize that, and don‚Äôt do any self criticism, you start envying other people having fun in a campus school such as Berkeley. Even though you don‚Äôt admit the reality, you feel jealous. You look at yourself and feel entitled to success, because this school makes you feel like you are superior to other people if you succeed in these courses and you start doubting yourself. But an individual that doesn‚Äôt do self criticism can‚Äôt find anything wrong with his/her trajectory when they doubt themselves, so they start looking for flaws in other people and becomes annoying to the outside world because their opinion is something they don‚Äôt value. Considering this, if the OP of the ed thread really considers paying people money to meet other people, just take a step back, and consider your life decisions. You probably didn‚Äôt choose the life you have now. As children, we want to please our parents, but the duty of the parents is unconditional love, and if the child doesn‚Äôt learn this, he/she expects love and affection from other people conditionally. So he/she does what they know best, fitting to societal success standards. But is that really what you want. Do you even know what you want. The OP of the ed thread, what are you exactly looking for when you meet new people? Why do you want that so desperately that you‚Äôd consider paying money for it. Don‚Äôt forget, the only incentive of the people around you to be around you should be you, not any other incentive especially money. When you offer something like that you eliminate the possibility of unconditional affection, people liking you for who you are. But if you don‚Äôt know who you are or have low self esteem, it becomes exponentially more difficult for people to be around you because you implicitly feel worthless. This feeling is something you construct in your mind and something you can fix, but you have to give time. Also don‚Äôt think about what other people are doing, we are in college and hardly anyone knows what they are doing. Long story short focus on finding who you are and build up your self esteem. You are already in Berkeley so you did something and with the logical prowess these courses give to you, it is easy to come up with an optimal moral and ethical model and find what you want to do. The comment by the professor is unprofessional and holds negative impact because it just reinforces OP‚Äôs opinions while they are subjectively not true, and you can‚Äôt have an objective opinions on topics such as this.
Where did he post this? I'm adding it to Wikipedia and I want to make sure I source this correctly. Thanks.
I‚Äôve been dating my gf for 4 years now lmao just don‚Äôt be ugly and you good
imagine being a girl from the bay area in his class right now... 

&#x200B;

i get that he has tenure but jfc if you have these thoughts keep them to yourself.
https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances/
Jesus Christ, I hope this is a shitpost. Profs need to think twice about what they post on university-affiliated forums. Gross.
wtf
that‚Äôs why they call it Man-Jose‚Ä¶ ü§ì
He‚Äôs spot on, cope harder!
Where is the lie though?
If you're offended by this, you're probably one of the women he's talking about.
Here are my thoughts on this as a guy in the Bay Area who has dated for 15 years here 20 -30's - I'm just going to keep my mouth shut.
Every large population area says this
Grew up in San Francisco. I agree with him, but would add the dating market for women isn‚Äôt all that great either I imagine. I‚Äôve met amazing women here but compared to places like NY, Mexico City, even Dublin there is a stark difference.
I don‚Äôt know how this can be said any more clearly:  if women avoid you, it‚Äôs because you have a shit personality. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs crazy how many incels just can‚Äôt accept this, but I guess they wouldn‚Äôt be incels if they weren‚Äôt delusional.
""Wahhh I hate when ambitious women who live in one of the most expensive places in the US have higher standards than those in the midwest wahhhhh"" What a joke of a man, much less a professor.
That. Is an incel.
I mean I've been on a some dates with good women but then a few not. Every girl I met here is in college and they're Hella busy so it sucks cuz I just work my 9-5 and I got nun else to do.
‚ÄúArtillery distance‚Äù is so threatening like what? And ‚Äúbehavior‚Ä¶‚Äù ew. I was in humanities at Cal but feel terrible for the girls studying CS there, and terrible for women in the Bay Area generally given this comment section
FACTS üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I mean to be honest. It is not the best place to be if you‚Äôre a straight man looking for a long term trad wife. The women here all want to be in charge yet do nothing. And then complain that men don‚Äôt want them. They don‚Äôt understand the transactional nature of relationships. And sex is not what men pay for. They pay for the relationship.

 I don‚Äôt meet any women willing to do dishes or cook for a man that takes care of her and takes her places here. Like that‚Äôs the relationship the things you do for each other. And no women in the Bay Area want that. If they do they‚Äôre probably in church.
Actually get out of Northern California period. That place is a cesspool of psychopaths, meth addicts, coke/ketamine whores and STDs.
This literally is not even that bad and is entirely true, people are just looking for an excuse to act offended over nothing
Facts. Everyone wants to move her but none of you learn about it first, do you? San Jose has been Man Jose for decades. He's helping you out. Simple facts.
Americans will use anything except for the metric system
Uh yea üëã Arizona here and it‚Äôs very common talk that to avoid any woman from California. 3/4 of them are fucked.
The truth.
1) He's not wrong, 2) Live and live, assholes, why are you trying to get someone fired for a milktoast opinion?
""women are plentiful"", why is he describing women like objects like farmland or livestock??
i personally think he is right, and that the reaction to this post demonstrates that.

 ""people act differently outside the bay area"" should not be a controversial statement just because ""people"" is ""women"". you're acting like he's a rapist because he implied some of you are undesirable. that's not a crime. some of you are genuinely insufferable, especially with how you demand moral perfection from everyone around you, and have no qualms against RUINING SOMEONE'S LIFE over an off-color remark. people are allowed to not want to be with you, lmao, especially when you display such a flagrant willingness to exploit others' mistakes.  


idk if you've heard this, but everyone makes mistakes. relationships are about compromise.. not demands and ultimatums.   


if you're assuming this post is about you, it is, and he's right. LOL
I won't touch the part accusing anybody of any particular behavior, but the sex gap in the Bay Area is one of the biggest in the country

>Rank	Metro	Gender gap  
1	McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX	28.5% more women  
2	El Paso, TX	27.3% more women  
3	Memphis, TN-MS-AR	17.5% more women  
4	Bethesda-Gaithersburg-Frederick, MD	16.9% more women  
**5	San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA	16.7% more men**  
\[...\]  
**19	San Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City, CA	12.3% more men**

I mean he's not wrong? Whenever there is a drastic difference in number of men and women, either direction, you'll get behavioral differences. A guy I know was just in Poland for work and the city he visited had some big colleges where the ratio of women to men was like 3 to 1. They come to you in cities like that.
How is that offensive to you people‚Ä¶.? If it‚Äôs not true why would it bother you? Clearly there‚Äôs some truth to it if you‚Äôre so offended‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing wrong being picky if you have options as a woman. Men shouldn‚Äôt complain about the odds. Good ones will always find good mates. 

Stop being so sensitive. There will be more obstacles ahead my friends‚Ä¶. This is hardly anything to get fussy about. Get over it , it is his opinion. Let it be.
It‚Äôs actually true. Almost everywhere else in the world women flirt and welcome flirting.
Tell me you‚Äôre an incel without telling me you‚Äôre an incel
This is really not acceptable, who can we report to?
I find it ironic that the students (and potential alumni) on here of the so called free speech revering Berkeley want to cancel and fire a man expressing his views on dating culture. 

Women at Berkeley often say things like they won‚Äôt date short men or white men or even ‚Äòmen are dogs.‚Äô Nothing. It‚Äôs like they just said the sky is blue. 

But god forbid a man express his standards, preferences, and negative experiences. 

It‚Äôs sad how unprepared and fragile students are today. Good luck in the real world.
lol the Bay Area is one of the few places demographically with more men than women. He's not technically wrong ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Not wrong though.

So, I crawled through his social media. Wow, this guy is a real peach. Does he have tenure? It looks as if he might, which is too bad. If not, he may not ever get it anywhere at all ever. one can hope. He should not be teaching anyone. what a fucker.

I can tell you from experience multiple times, the whole ‚Äúdating in Bay Area is impossible‚Äù is simply untrue. Yes there are plenty of stuck up types around, however most are genuine people. I just see a lot of dates where they fumble through it or the guy is all clammed up.
Pov insufferable incel techie that can't dance so he can't get laid
Been dating Bay Area women exclusively since I was in my late twenties, and happily married one. This guy is weak.
They're not wrong. Have had my share of experiences

and see this:

I actually agree with him. Dating is strange in the Bay area for a straight male.
Places where professors are plentiful like UC Berkeley still have this kind of shitty professor :)
WHO LET HIM COOK
""wow someone says something slightly out of pocket now the whole berkeley community goes up in hands"" ah post
You are a dangerous man and should not be anywhere near young women. Shame on UC Berkeley for not dismissing you on the spot.
Yall are so fucking annoying and sensitive, he is just sharing his opinion based on his experience. Ive lived in 3 different continents and tbh both men and women are pretty shit in sf compared to the rest of the word so he‚Äôs not fully wrong. People can have opinions, if you dont agree with it just take it with a grain of salt and move on
Is he wrong though?
maybe he right. Let him cook!! üî•üî•üî•üî•
He's 100% right. Kudos for having the stones to speak the truth
LMFAOOO I LOVE THIS MAN I NEED HIS CLASS N O W HOLY SHIT HAHAHAHAHAGAGAHAHA
Those are facts is what that is.
Why is no one discussing whether or not he's right?
He's got a point
This? This, my friend, is the motherfucking troof.
The truth is the truth
Give this man a raise
I don't understand why people are so worked up about this?

It reads to me like he's implying women are more selective in an area where they are (supposedly) underrepresented, which is something one would expect to be true anyway (ie. supply v. demand etc...)
I live in LA and we used to call this ‚Äúgetting berkelified.‚Äù Girls would go to college in the Bay Area looking like Kelly Kapowski and come back looking like Kurt Cobain. They‚Äôd come back saying shit like ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôd say that. You‚Äôre the patriarchy!‚Äù and I‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 21, and I work at Blockbuster. And I don‚Äôt see how this relates to your late fee for your rental of *The Craft*. And I‚Äôm not gonna lie to you, I thought it was pronounced ‚Äòpatri-Archie‚Äô and I also don‚Äôt know what that is. That‚Äôll be $2.50.‚Äù

Hahaha this is what I've been saying since I met my wife (Lebanese).

To clarify, generalizing such as this shouldn't be used in a totally serious context. This is the kind of shit someone should say to their friends as a joke because there's no way to know every woman's personality and life decisions in any given region. People are vastly different. 

But I stand by it. No one will ever compare to my old lady, especially not Americans. We all suck.

Salty that liberal white girls are hella into BBC cuz I have no problem gettin fine girls that respect me and treat me right
Wow to all the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs right‚Äù commentary here.  Wtf?  He‚Äôs a prof speaking abt going ‚Äúwhere women are plentiful‚Äù to obtain a gf.  Do you not see how demeaning that is?!  Women are a commodity to go acquire - as he apparently did from the PI based on the FB pix of his  teenage-looking wife in a totally inappropriate pose for a spouse photo.  By commenting on women‚Äôs ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù he seems to believe his inability to date locally (an independent and financially secure woman??) is not about him at all.
Super inappropriate given his position and the forum.   It‚Äôs a devaluation of women, a belief that he‚Äôs somehow entitled to women, and it‚Äôs super ick.  It‚Äôs not a vanilla statement abt dating life.
>""Where women are plentiful""

What a strange person.  Most people in the Bay Area are women.  Incels probably don't know that.
Some student made a post about not being sure what to do in the future, someone else responded basically saying the job market is fucked and academia is insanely hard, and that the only thing keeping him going is knowing that getting a girlfriend is harder ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùì
That guy who made the reddit post a while back about wanting to pay to meet girls posted the same thing to the 189 Ed.
the fuck is ""artillery distance""??
Why does he go to that one when he literally lives (lived?) above the one on University

Hey Michael! As someone who went to class with you, I know you have high integrity and it's great to see you and other current faculty standing up against this!
From an alum, props.
Shewchuk needs to be dismissed. No parent should be paying for their daughter to be taught by an incel.
Michael Ball still goated
On top of that a person in CS complaining about the behavior of others in such a condescending way is so ironic. Like maybe it's because so many people in this space act that way that they have bad experiences with women. If you treat women like actual people and not objects, you'll find a vast majority of them will treat you great, because women are people.
i have never felt so unwelcome in a class
This is unacceptable under any circumstances. Terrible behavior from anyone in the Berkeley community, but to see this from a professor is heartbreaking. This has no place on our campus whatsoever.

If I had children attending UC Berkeley I would advise them to avoid taking a class with this professor.
>the behavior of women

My interpretation of his statement was something like ""women are more picky in the Bay area""? Is that how you also read his statement? It seems like something one would expect to be true as well (e.g supply vs. demand ...)
Where did he ever used the word ‚Äúbad‚Äù?
Did he say bad or ""different"".
like, no offense, but.. why is not allowed to be bad?

&#x200B;

it's a crime he said some of your behavior is bad?  


you're incapable of bad behavior? or just immune from having it pointed out?
[removed]
^ this behavior honey
Exactly omg ur wording is so perfect I was too outraged to hone in on that part as the most problematic phrase üò≠ please please report him using the form!!
This is Berkeley
I would disagree with the stuff he said about data science. I think he made it clear he was criticizing the DS administration for not creating enough of their own classes and instead needing to borrow space in classes from other departments. He wasn't making a jab at DS students in the class themselves and no one resents DS majors for just enrolling in a class they were allowed to. Instead I found his post insightful, bringing awareness to some of the political issues among Berkeley departments that adversely affected many students; I think you would feel similarly if you didn't get into the class.

Totally agree with the stuff you said about his Ed post today though.
Of course it‚Äôs the ds majors complaining üò≠
No professor at Berkeley is redeemable after all the generations of students they tormented
https://yellow-corenda-27.tiiny.site/
The context is that he is replying to a (male?) student having difficulties dating. His claim is that when women significantly outnumber men in an area, they will tend to behave in ways that are tactically disadvantageous for the men trying to date in that area. Thus, he advises the student to find another dating market. He says nothing about how the behavior supposedly changes but ""picky"" seems like a good guess if you are trying to be at least somewhat charitable.
Also:

> I WAS BORN in Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada. I am a Canadian citizen and a U.S. permanent resident. I identify as a Smith & Wesson 460XVR .45 caliber revolver. (death/deathem/deathself.)

I checked his Facebook. Definitely a Passport Bro. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with being Passport Bro though
It‚Äôs better than over here. Passport bros ftw
Exacrly
It‚Äôs true tho
It's not a license to alienate a segment of the student population based solely on race or sex.  Tenure is meant to protect a professor from undeserved retribution that is the frequent consequence of having to grade students.
I won't write it again or copy it so please hit up this link:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/s/boT6Uk8BLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/s/boT6Uk8BLA)

tldr - tenure isn't immunity. Tenured profs get fired all the time, transferred to other institutions, retired, or ""encouraged"" to go into industry or elsewhere.

He will get on the Lex Fridman podcast and then Elon Musk will signal boost him for being attacked by the woke mob... And offer to pay for any legal fees if retaliation is necessary
And all of those people congregate on Reddit
Let me guess you're free Palestine?
Dude is a just a cs major. I can tell what you look IRL already lmao
c'est la vie. the optimal route for most would be minmaxxing social life, self improvement, and academics.
it took me years away...and maybe doing stupid shit/drugs to realize you know what, i'm content where i'm at in life and to look for the brighter things.  

fwiw, i don't think doing stupid shit and drugs should be the way to self realization.  that was just what i did, and i'm fortunate that these days i'm a family man, staying out of trouble, and haven't had a lick of alcohol or drugs in a very long time.
well put

Where he really fucked up was talking about their behavior change, as if women would stop being assertive and will cater to you in other places. But he is right, that this place is lopsided one way and there‚Äôs a lot of money here. An ok looking guy with little money, would def have more success somewhere else.
Yup, I agree. Have seen that myself too. This is just an unpopular truth that no one wants to accept.
its not exactly the best dating experience because of the behavior of bay area men but maybe i should consider dating in an area with less men idk
What the hell do you think the cost of living of an area has to do with dating standards?

a thing that can be counted can be plentiful. this shouldn't be a moral issue, don't treat it like a sacred cow. NUMBERS are not SEXIST
as a woman in his class, sure, I have no problem with that statement, but vaguely stating a fact before you fully jump off the rails doesn't make it any better.
And all of those people are heterosexual, right?
I just generally don't want these views to be expressed on EdStem, or at the very least a place where someone would expect academic advice. Even lecture would've been better as professors are generally known to just riff during lectures
You are misrepresenting his statement as simply an expression of view: Jonathan was completely within his capacity to say what the traits of someone you should aim to build a life with are and what the ideal dating situation is. There was nothing stopping him from exalting the values of a community he supports and giving positive reasons for valuing such, while damning the specific behaviors one ought to steer clear of when dating.

Instead, he chose to use this opportunity to implicate, specifically, women from the Bay Area of an *unnamed behavior* that makes them more difficult to date relative to other women. Many of these people are his very own students and are, in fact, *disagreeing* with him on this description of *their own personal behavior*. This enjoins his above opinion with a specific and unbacked critique of others he is offering. Every human is 100% in the right to call out overly-broad unevideced statements, such as the ones Jonathan has made here about Bay Area women and the ones you have critiqued from Cal women undergraduates about men.

When a person uses their freedom of speech to make a *specific* unevidenced yet damning claim, they are completely open to liability of the falsehood of those statements. Regardless of one's opinion on the broader appeal of women in the Bay Area relative to rural areas, people may fully hold him accountable for making overly broad and prima facie incorrect statements (obviously not all women here have a singular behavior); that is true whether he were calling all men dogs or accusing all Bay Area women of an unnamed behavior on this platform.
Yes, God forbid an INSTRUCTOR speak pejoratively about a category of student, whether that category be racial or by sex.  If you had a professor suggesting, for example, that he would be happier teaching in a community with fewer white students, I'm sure you would immediately see the issue.
Free speech is about being free to say something without legal action being taken, not being free to say something without any social consequences whatsoever. You just can‚Äôt wrap your mind around a standard of etiquette being set in the workplace. Anyone with a brain understands that highly-objectifying and sexist language was used in this conversation that was encouraged by and continued by this professor. That objectification directly impacts his female students and colleagues, and contributes to a feeling of gender-based anxiety and discomfort while their male peers will never have to feel anything similar. Now according to you, after this happens, we are supposed to do nothing. That‚Äôs your idea of a fair society. There‚Äôs simply nothing fair about that.

And PS‚Ä¶let‚Äôs cut out this ‚Äúreal world‚Äù BS. The workplace *is* the real world, and this is not acceptable.

It‚Äôs borderlines, he might get a warning and not get fired even after making an apology.

Compared to the horror and sexual criminal activity seen in industry, this is minor
Tenured profs can be fired.

I helped have one be. He literally wasted everyone's time bragging about his vacations, came to class late drinking his XL gas station soda, and took calls from his kid in the middle of bragging about vacations only to come back in and start telling us about how stupid his son is.

This was a fundamental core course at a top tiered US university.

I was working 3 jobs and taking small loans to pay the $50k a year.

About 15 min before lecture was to be over he'd as me, because I sat in the front row, what time it is, and then he'd jump through his 100 slide plagiarized lecture and say, ""this is important, this is important, ignore these, copy this one.""

He expected you to cheat on the exams. It was bad. I was the only one to get a D while everyone else got 100%. Why? Because I studied. They all already knew to copy the questions and answers that he provided. He even bragged that we wouldn't need a calculator. I still ended up acing the class and had our cohort sit down with the department head and had a conversation.

That prof was sent away almost immediately.

To be fair, others had complained in the past, but I came in as an older student with a bit better perspective and constructive feedback. My approach drove home that those other students weren't just whining. Despite him bringing in TONS of research funding, he was eroding the quality of the university's education and prestige.

Some years after my time another prof had their faculty site covered in trump logos, like literally covered like a crazy person's bumper stickers.

They got sacked too.

Tenure doesn't mean what people think that it does. It's not a get out of jail free card and it isn't a pass to do really stupid things. But people get away with stupid stuff until higher ups are clearly presented with why it's a problem.
I am so confused by the grandstanding here.
  Isn't what he said simply true? Try this: visit a pub in the Berkeley area, then a pub near UC San Diego, let me know what you notice about the different social dynamics.

Edit: not sure what he means by ""... Where women are plentiful..."" That part makes little sense to me, but the Idea that the dating market is bizarre in the Bay Area seems... Well... Have you walked around in the bay area?
seconding this. u/_mball_, thank you for always being an upstanding professor working to advance equity, respect, and professionalism in EECS. it means a lot-- seriously.

How‚Äôs the job search going fellow alum?
>If you treat women like actual people and not objects, you'll find a vast majority of them will treat you great, because women are people.

This is bogus as, first, it makes assumptions about how these men interact with women and second it assumes the majority of women will treat men ""great"" if men act a certain way. What do you even mean by "" treat women like actual people and not objects"" It's such a cliche and means nothing. How are they treating them objects? Give evidence.
Finally, you are summarily dismissing the experiences of others simply because they are men. If the women complained about bad experiences with men, would you be so quick to blame the women?
No this is so crazy I was gonna take 189 this sem as a woman in the CS major but decided not to this would tilt me off the face of the planet omg , also heads up that RAIYAN guy is hella weird. been in classes with him and he‚Äôs so fuckin annoying in the discord
I'm sorry. You deserve better.
Regardless why is a professor commenting on this topic??
The scarcity argument is only barely true. SF and San Jose have more single men, but the east bay has more single women than single men. 

And I don‚Äôt see how this relates to college students. Don‚Äôt youse all mostly date other students, where there‚Äôs a pretty even split?
Yea this is obviously what he meant. The interpretations of this as a misogynistic comment are totally without merit.
do you ever wonder if maybe this is the behavior that makes women dislike you?
Agreed
I get that but imo gives the sense that DS students are not wanted in 189. Even if it wasn‚Äôt blamed on them, it‚Äôs not a comfortable or welcoming feeling to know that if the prof had their way, you would not be enrolled.

Iirc, there was also some negativity towards DS students in the discord after that announcement, spurred on by his comments.

But I agree that these recent comments blow that out of the water, I just don‚Äôt think this is an isolated example. Shewchuck has no problem with making statements that make a large portion of his class uncomfortable, which is literally the direct opposite of the purpose of Ed.
Isn't the insinuation about the Bay Area the opposite - significantly more single men than single women i.e. the men outnumber the women?
this is true lol

Body shaming, nice!
It‚Äôs incredibly creepy. Half of them are too in denial to accept the reason why they have to visit 2nd/3rd world countries is because they‚Äôre either ugly or seriously creepy & only women who have to tolerate that to get out of their circumstance will deal with it. It‚Äôs like sexual arbitrage but worse because it‚Äôs continuously living in denial that you‚Äôre a loser. Also consider the psychology of a man who seeks out a partner who has little to no power advantage in the relationship. It‚Äôs quite predatory
If Prof happy being a passport bro. Good for him. I just hope he does so ethically.

No it‚Äôs not. Go outside and you‚Äôll see plenty of guys under 6ft with girlfriends. The average man is shorter than 6 feet, and the average man has no problems finding people to date.

Unfortunately it is real
I'm not sure how to reconcile this though. Not that I'm comparing him to Einstein, but Einstein had some fairly reprehensible beliefs about women as well. It's not uncommon for men in advanced scientific fields to have many different distasteful beliefs. Should someone who contributes towards the advancement of society in one area, but contributes negatively in another be prevented from holding such a position?

NOPE.

I speak from my own experiences as a woman who was living in Southern/more rural parts of the US vs the Bay Area/Silicon Valley. Yes the dating standards are different.
What part of his comment is ""fully off the rails""?
do you want to go further and accuse him of racism, by implying that, since he left the ""unnamed behavior"" of ""certain women"" unnamed, he must have therefore been talking about blacks?

As far as I'm aware, no he doesn't. I've been seeing your comments across all these threads, and from my hunch, it seems like you're just looking to spread drama about about EECS professors. You've hinted at allegations against Garcia, Sahai, and now Michael too. Please elaborate if there is actually something here, but to me it seems like you're just trying to start drama.
Yes, we see you reply this on every post/comment he makes. I guess it would be more fair to say that you and he have some history and you are dealing with it by dogging him on Reddit. My wish for you in the future is that for each time you drop little innuendo about him, that someone accuses you anonymously of some bullshit.
Buddy, I'm in EECS myself, I see how so many of the guys in many classes act and talk. So many of these guys, intentional or not, are misogynists. I've heard guys talk about women getting into the major as only ""diversity admits"". Or whenever they interact with women, they seem to have a sense that the woman is inferior to them. On top of that, they view a girlfriend as something to ""get"" and not as a partner in life, they view it as a trophy. It's not most guys, but it is a noticeable portion of the people in the classes. 

Additionally, I literally do not see what Shewchuk talks about. I have lived in the Bay Area for 14 years and aside from a few women, I have never had a significant problem with how they act. My best friend is a Bay Area woman and so is literally the nicest person I know.

Finally, I do call out women that are misandrist, I don't know why you would assume otherwise. Problem is that it doesn't really ever happen in my field, especially not from the professors.
Exactly üíØ
Bruh just outed himself as an incelüíÄ
As a Berkeley CS Alum who is also a woman, hang in there! We need more people like you in academia and industry.
an attempt to empathize with a mal studet.
Sure. Let's just say the prof's supply/demand analysis was based on imaginary data. How does any of that mean he was being misogynistic if he was simply saying something along the line of ""women are more selective in areas where there are less of them""?
He was talking to a student who was asking about the future.
These things aren't mutually exclusive? He is making a statement about supply and demand, but there's certainly a negative connotation there about how the ""scarcity"" of women affects their behavior. Seems pretty misogynistic to me.

(Not to mention the framing of women as ""plentiful"" or ""scarce"", like some kind of resource.)
You say if you were in DS you'd feel discouraged by the announcement. What if you didn't get into the class at all and had spent 10-20 hours on the first two homeworks and now have a messed up schedule? I think that's much more terrible than being a DS major in the class where you still have just as fair a chance of learning the material. At some point, bringing attention to the DS admins's faults is fair to raise awareness and prevent the same massive loss of time and effort among dropped students from happening in the future.

The end goal is not to block data students from joining, but rather to expand the class in the future or perhaps crosslist as data science to get more funding. So the goal is inclusive, not exclusive and Shewchuk wasn't trying to just kick data students out.
because guys not being able to find a girlfriend probably has more to do with the guy being the problem than an entire demographic of people‚Äôs behavior

There's plenty of [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/19445vs/you_cannot_be_a_passport_bro_and_complain_about/) on that sub about hypergamy. The guys are fully aware they are not high status.

Really don't get the hate for them - most lower status guys just live shitty lives. These guys recognize their situation, are audacious enough to move to another country to find a mate, and end up in a win-win situation for them and their wife.
I agree with you especially when there‚Äôs a huge age gap and the guy looks like Jabba the Hutt, and yes, he does look creepy. However, I don‚Äôt buy the equation passportbro = creepy predator. After all, it‚Äôs the same as when a girl is severely overweight and can‚Äôt find a boyfriend.
No that‚Äôs not true

Let us define the following:
- Let \(P\) represent the set of all popular beliefs.
- Let \(T\) represent the set of all true statements.
- Orthogonality, in this context, implies that the two sets \(P\) and \(T\) are independent of each other.

**Assumption 1:** Cats are adorable.
- Note: This is widely regarded as a popular belief, thus \( \text{""Cats are adorable""} \in P \).

**Assumption 2:** The Earth revolves around the Sun.
- This is a true statement based on scientific consensus, thus \( \text{""The Earth revolves around the Sun""} \in T \).

To demonstrate that popularity and truth are not orthogonal, we need to show that there exists at least one element that is both popular and true.

**Lemma 1:** Cute Cat Videos are Extremely Popular.
- Evidence: The existence of millions of cat videos on the internet and their significant view counts.
- Thus, \( \text{""People love watching cat videos""} \in P \).

**Lemma 2:** Watching Cute Cat Videos Increases Happiness.
- This is supported by scientific studies showing that watching cute animals can reduce stress and increase feelings of happiness.
- Thus, \( \text{""Watching cat videos increases happiness""} \in T \).

**Theorem:** If watching cute cat videos increases happiness (a truth) and is also extremely popular, then the sets \(P\) and \(T\) are not orthogonal because they share at least one element that is both popular and true.

**Proof by Absurdity:**
- Suppose \(P\) and \(T\) were orthogonal. This would imply there are no elements that are both popular and true.
- However, we have demonstrated that the phenomenon of watching cat videos is both a popular activity and truthfully increases happiness.
- This contradiction implies our supposition 

Hence they are not orthogonal

I think you will be terrified to know that he's not stupid, his research work and academic career have absolutely made him deserving of tenure. As a lecturer he is above average at Berkeley.

Isn't u/Cuir-et-oud just criticizing the professor, saying he's one of those typical white men who prey on women in third-world countries? It's a well-known phenomenon that goes on, and it's criticism about these specific white men. For context, this professor is apparently rumored to have done that.
""the average man has no problems finding people to date."" how do you reconcile this viewpoint with the graph showing 63% of men 18-29 are single in the last year? You are empirically wrong no? The average man coming of age empirically is having unprecedented levels of trouble finding people to date.
Only in your dreams could you imagine dating me LOL
Ya, and a female teacher saying that would be unacceptable too? Congrats.

that's a bit hostile. I've always disagreed with the ""just asking questions"" thing. It kind of assumes a person can't be honestly asking you something? which isn't fair to them. most people aren't out to deceive you.

I ask you to trust that I, at least, am acting in good faith. I gave you an upvote as a sign of good faith.

Still, do you believe that free speech is protected at berkeley? I ask this because it seems certain opinions are not allowed, and my understanding of the point free speech / academic freedom is that no discussion should be off-limits. If there's anywhere where you should be able to critically examine controversial topics in the pursuit of hidden or unorthodox truths, it should be at a university, among fellow intellectuals.

Anecdotally, personally, I lean towards ""there is not free speech at berkeley"" because of the one time I said ""I think capitalism sometimes has its merits"" in a study group, and the blue-haired girl next to me told everyone she should hit me for saying that. and no one objected.

So I am curious if you do or do not perceive a culture of academic freedom, especially among controversial topics.

actively encouraging and participating in ongoing toxicity towards women in an ed post
I didn't accuse Jonathan of sexism or racism anywhere in my message. Feel free to re-read it. I said his students are accurately highlighting his willful misrepresentation of themselves, and for this they have a valid claim in saying he is in the wrong.

His claim was that Women from the Bay Area engage in an unnamed behavior which makes them less dateable. We have evidence this is not true, because:

1. Jonathan is unwilling to name the behavior and accuses no specific individual of actually doing such. If it were true, such an ask would be simple to back up with data and an actual claim of action.
2. Homogenizing the actions of *individuals* as a group action is only accurate if it truly reflects a bijection, which is almost certainly not true of such a large population.
3. His students, who are a part of the group, have offered a counterargument, for which Jonathan has no possible epistemic takedown without the evidence as outlined in point 1.

He was completely in his capacity to say that *some* women engage in behavior XYZ, and these are people one should not date. Such a claim would not be sexist, racist, or any set of discriminatory phrase: it takes issue with a behavior that some individuals take.

Instead, he has claimed *an entire group of people* engage in *something or other* that makes them difficult to date. Whether he said that was Women from the Bay Area, Black People from the Bay Area, or Students in the Bay Area, this statement ought to be qualified for its truth value. If it is lacking in truth, then any aggrieved party Jonathan is actively lying about may properly take issue with him. As it stands, Jonathan's statement is so overly broad any Republican tradwife in the Bay Area and his own wife is likewise guilty of such action, which is beyond a silly sentiment. We should be holding people to the standards of *their behavior*. Jonathan's argument was constructed such that it implicates people *regardless of their behavior*.
just based. we need to expose the truth and reality of the world. professors like shewchuk are doing gods work.
Bro is making a joke about dumb LA/Bay Area transplants in the 90s. 

Bay Area people are a joy to talk to. They‚Äôre all like ‚ÄúNuh-uh! A dumb quip that has a vague reference to a fictitious woman? Not on my watch pal! That‚Äôs the patriarchy!!!‚Äù
I'm not dating because my wife would not let me.

All the argument against him are about building a strawman. He only suggested to look for a date outside of the Bay Area. I don't even argue if he's wrong or right. His opinion is objectively harmless to anyone. Factually: men to women ratio in BA is skewed [check], women behavior bc of this is different from other areas [check] (maybe bc they have to go through _worse_ shit to get a normal date, I don't know), => it's easier to find a date outside [check].

Calm the fuck down. The guy is stupid for using inappropriate channels to communicate his opinion, but it's harmless.
Serious question. Do you think it would be better if answered something like: ""Thoughts about women distract you from studying CS."" or something stupid like that to get the conversation off the board?

Why would your experience be the same as other men? You can't assume every man who has had bad experiences dating is a misogynist and just because some men can easily date, that doesn't mean all will be successful. And the locale and culture may have a role to play for such outcomes.

Apropos typo.
He didn‚Äôt say they were more selective. He said they had undesirable behavior.
One thing I wonder about is why it‚Äôs DS admins fault tbh. They bought seats but didn‚Äôt CS admins sell them?

But I agree that waitlisted students had it worse. Tbh I guess I don‚Äôt personally see how the announcement helped anyone, other than making everyone more mad, but I see how it could be viewed as raising awareness.

Tbh, atp I don‚Äôt think it matters, I just was reminded of it cause I felt it was an out of pocket post that was largely just a pool of negativity. 

The important thing is that this recent post is unacceptable, and we agree on that.
This sub has already rotten mine and many other brains
What's wrong with women from SEA? Are you implying they are inferior to western women? And the US has plenty of poor people. If a professor married a poor woman from MS, you of course would have a problem with that, right?
How is creepy equivalent to being overweight?

Separate argument but there are plenty of overweight men & women who can and have found partners (arguably harder but possible)
If a woman is overweight and can‚Äôt get a boyfriend, and then decides to go find a man who will be her boyfriend because that‚Äôs his only way out of poverty, I would call her a creep as well.

I am just pointing the fact that men aren‚Äôt the only ones saying these things
I disagree with you. Sahai and Ranade are married now? What they did was  in violation of professinal ethics.  You can't know what happened in Professor Sahai's (first) marriage, nor do you know the full story of his second marriage. Presumably they were adults and are now a durable couple. Not a good look at the start, but they now have a relationship of mutual and consenting benefit to each of them. What this Incel-adjacent (at best) Professor Shitcock has done is abuse his position of power to broadcast his disdain of women and make it abundently clear that they are not really part of ""CS club."" Imagine being one of the women in that department and reading this? He's also given cover to the young men who view him as a professional mentor;  now they know they can get away with making sexist and exclusionary pronouncements and get away with it.

Ooh you really burned me‚Ä¶anyways
There is no perfect person. We all cast judgement having done wrong ourselves. That‚Äôs just reality. I think it‚Äôs strange that when someone makes an empathetic statement (sympathizing with the women that he has disrespected) you‚Äôre go-to assumption is that they are looking to bolster themselves. Some people just make empathetic statements because they‚Äôre experiencing empathy‚Ä¶
yeah, true
This is a weird comment LOL but to be clear, I never said Bay Area women are ""better"" or other women are ""worse"", I said the standards are different. I don't even know what the rest of your comment means, tbh.
It's interesting that you talk about ""encouraging and participating in ongoing toxicity"" when looking at your response to a simple look at that data.

There's a reason I specifically said that I wasn't addressing any other claims. Yet, as you say ""ongoing toxicity"" indeed.
Can you quote and analyze the part of his comment you think actively encourages toxicity towards women?

Given the context of his comment (he was giving advice to a male student who said he was having a difficult time finding a girlfriend in Berkeley) and the literal content of his comment, to me it looks like tactical advice that the Bay Area is not a good place for men to date, which can easily be interpreted as a sociological or economic claim, not a ""toxic"" or misogynistic one per se.

I will agree an ed post is not a good place for this advice or conversation.
it's uncomfortable how you're referring to him by his first name. say what you will about the man, but the title deserves more respect than that.  


i don't think a 4-sentence ED post has enough data in it for you to extrapolate like this.  


i don't understand how you can seriously say it's impossible and offensive that ""an entire group of people engage in something or other that makes them difficult to date"".   
like, they DO. **you're projecting specifics**. the general statement is .. undeniable? ""an entire group of people is different"" yes, duh, obviously?   
\> Jonathan's argument was constructed such that it implicates people regardless of their behavior.  
it pretty specifically mentioned behavior, that was 1/4th of the message.
Ok
This disconnect on the meaning of his words is key to the problem.  Ur interpretation is totally male-centric and completely lacking in understanding how women are impacted and devalued by these words - particularly when made by their professor in a stem setting
Referring him to health services to talk to someone would‚Äôve been appropriate.
Antonio, if you are reading this

# YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID
I'm not saying my experience is the same as other men, but in the same vein, I'm not making sweeping generalizations about half the population. It'd be fine if he said something like ""I also had a rough time dating in the Bay"" (altho not rlly, it's Ed, not Reddit or Twitter) but to say that all women act a certain (bad) way? Yeah no, that's a massive, untrue generalization that should receive backlash.
Geez, I've never seen anything that bad, so maybe it's getting a little better (?)
Thank you!! You got this! Almost there!
I‚Äôm also ironically getting married to a short Berkeley CS boy ü§ì, the kind that ‚Äúcan‚Äôt ever find a girlfriend‚Äù.
To be honest, he didn't even say ""undesirable behavior"".

He simply said ""stark difference between behavior of women here compared to elsewhere where women are more \*plentiful\*"".

It seems pretty clear to me that he was making a supply/demand kind of statements. I think y'all overreacting a bit.
You bring up a fair point. It wasn't necessarily their fault, but both departments should work towards better predicting the size of the class's demand and securing the necessary funding. This is what I viewed Shewchuk's post as pointing towards. Glad we see eye to eye.
It‚Äôs a similar example because in both cases, due to themselves, they are unable, or unlikely, to find a partner
Mine are speculations as I never met a passport bro, but I see your point. We both think it‚Äôs about working on yourself.

Who said it should be tolerated? I'm saying it is important to recognize that intelligent people, talented researchers and good teachers are completely capable of ignorance and bigotry. It is important not to minimize their success and influence when calling them out.
Talks about maturity, personally attacks me twice.
So you're not adding anything relevant to the conversation, got it.
I'm just saying what he did not making moral judgements about who's worse
Caution that this poster has been very active in this thread throwing unsourced shade at a ton of professors.  Take with a grain of salt
No seriously, look at past threads and ask past alum. Sahai did a lot of unprofessional things, there is a reason why so many faculty members in EECS tell you during their private meetings not to take a course with him‚Ä¶
[removed]
op was talking abt women ""about to expire"" 

complaining about the ""behavior of women""

can you not see how this language might be harmful to women witnessing this in the class?
oh btw, happy cake day!
Jonathan uses his first name in the post, just like many educators such as myself at Cal. You feeling weird about that is neither his nor my business to care about until he asks to be called something else.

> i don't understand how you can seriously say it's impossible and offensive

Please point to where I made such a claim. I said that if such a statement is ""lacking in truth"", those who it is about are in the right to bring grievance against those claiming it. No where did I say such is impossible or offensive. I called this instantiation factually incorrect.

> ""an entire group of people engage in something or other that makes them difficult to date"".   

Please tell me what the *something* is. Name the behavior for me. Jonathan failed to do so, so I would very much like to know. If it is honestly a bijection and I am in the wrong, I will openly admit it and say you are correct: all ABC people engage in XYZ. If, however, all the ABC people you accuse of doing that XYZ behavior *do not* actually engage in that behavior, they are firmly in their right to deny your claim and say you are in the wrong. That is about as reasonable as it gets: mistruths ought to be removed from our beliefs.
Women are not impacted and devalued by these words. They are not even related to women in any way. They are about _men_ looking for _women_, unless you see something wrong with it. They have _zero_ impact on women by design of the question.
That's the woke bullshit. Health services are not sex workers. The guy asking this wanted to get laid not to get his blood checked.
Did he say all? Or was the implication more that it's generally different. I don't know, but I was actually more referring to the students in the forum who were expressing frustration with finding friends and mates.
If that‚Äôs what he meant ‚Äî that due to scarcity, women could afford to be more picky in the Bay ‚Äî he could have said that. Maybe he could‚Äôve suggested that OP would need to work on himself to stand out more. 

But he didn‚Äôt. He chose to focus on the _shock[ing]_ behavior of Bay Area women and the implication is clear that it‚Äôs the women that are problematic in the dating scene here.
Yes, the clear implication of his statement is that due to scarcity, women in the bay area behave poorly because they know they can get away with it.

This is different from being more selective. You can understand people being offended by the implication that they behave badly because they can get away with it. Right?
He‚Äôs still a misogynist though, right?

Like fine, we can talk about a good point in good faith‚Ä¶ The school admin is failing both their CS and DS majors by not producing enough classes for them to get their degrees on schedule.

Are you going to argue that him making that point refutes any other complaints though?

Because bringing this up is otherwise just a red herring argument to distract from the point. 

I agree, THIS thing he said wasn‚Äôt really out of line (though I think he may be more biased against DS than you give credit and his attitude kinda shows through in the statement) and the core point shouldn‚Äôt be lost by either putting him out or at the very least on a short leash in regards to sexist content/remarks within his official capacity (he can be a douche bag on Facebook and on his own time with his poor wife who will probably leave him as soon as she legally can, but not through any channels of him officially as a staff member, including lectures and online)
That‚Äôs not the same as a man being creepy. A women being creepy is the same as a man being creepy
So you now believe that passport bros are creepy? My comment was describing the definition of a passport bro
I know this is a joke, but this proof isn't even correct lol. You're confusing independence with disjointness.
Someone ‚Äî very notably not you ‚Äî clarified some of the Sahai stuff elsewhere in this thread. But I noticed that elsewhere, you also suggested something messed-up relating to Professor Ball. And when people asked you for clarification, you didn't respond, despite being very active throughout the comment section. 

What is the point of bringing up references to accusations, and then refusing to elaborate? Wouldn't it be helpful to provide actual information? I'm not even saying you're lying, given someone else provided additional info about Sahai. I'm just saying you're being rather unhelpful. 

So I'll ask: do you care to clarify what you meant re: Professor Ball? I would love to know if there's an actual specific warning.
[deleted]
I can easily see how it is at least emotionally harmful since the women in his class have expressed feeling hurt and excluded by it.

I believe the ""about to expire"" comment was from a student, not the professor. Part of the problem here is that the user who posted this screenshot omits all context and baits outrage.

The ""behavior of women"" phrase can be read as a moralizing comment (i.e. ""women here behave badly and they should not"") or as a tactical comment (i.e. ""women here behave in a way that is not favorable to men trying to date, so you should date elsewhere""). I think the context supports the latter more. Regardless, he should have kept this thought to himself or given the advice in a private conversation.
> op was talking abt women ""about to expire""

Fwiw, read the post again, he's talking about relationships that ""expired"" due to not keeping up communication like some kind nat table timeout.

The guy is weird and lonely but legitimately nothing he said seems misogynistic.
I feel weird about it, and I feel like, under your code of ethics, that's reason enough for you to stop doing it. Respect the way in which you're making me uncomfortable, violating social norms about afforded respects. I have, as you say, a right to deny your claim.  


I can't tell you what the *something* is because it isn't defined. It could mean basically anything, from the mundane to the extreme, that fulfils the given boundary conditions ""reasons why women in the bay area are not conducive towards this student getting a girlfriend"" and ""stark differences between women in the bay area vs other regions"". Personally, I can think of ten things that immediately satisfy those boundary conditions, but those would be my solutions, not necessarily his.

Additionally you are projecting the word **""all""** into this statement. It shouldn't be read as ""all women in the bay area are not conducive towards this student getting a girlfriend, due to differences with other women that become stark when you go somewhere else"". It should be read ""For most of the women that you are going to interact with in the bay area, student, you will not find much success in asking them to date you. Other women in other regions will be much more likely to accept you, and their differences in behavior, compared to the aforementioned bay area women, will be stark.""  


Like, how can you possibly disprove that? By this point I've clocked on to the fact that you know something extra about logic and semantics, so I'm genuinely curious as to how you could possibly do that. For one, you'd have to know the experiences and psyche of the original asking student, which we don't. For another, it seems an undeniable fact that people in other places are different.
I suppose there is some bliss in having a simple mind‚Ä¶enjoy
I said ‚Äútalk‚Äù, right?  Like he‚Äôs depressed and could need actual help

Anyway‚Ä¶https://youtu.be/ZUmI1tNRYjc?si=b0dvuExKfX6UTb_2
If you're referring to the students, then, in general, I don't have a problem with them (as long as it's being voiced in a proper avenue, not Ed). However, the thing is that a lot of these rants tend to be, at the very least, pretty terribly worded. Again, as I said before, it could be unintentional, I certainly don't think they're all misogynists, but these tend to be people who lack proper social etiquette and awareness (CS does tend to attract these people), so when then they go on their rants, they don't realize the impact of their words. They often include statements that could be misconstrued as, or downright are, misogynist.

My point is more so that it's incredibly disheartening that a professor doesn't see how their words could impact others, regardless of whether or not they meant in that way.
Lol. He talked about the ""difference in behavior of women here compared to other places where there are more of them"". He only mentioned ""difference of behavior"" not ""shocking behavior"". 

You need to actually read his statement instead of just regurgitating the inflammatory sentiment you've seen here.
That's clearly what he meant you are grasping at straws here
I don't see him implying anywhere that women ""behave poorly"". 

You're extrapolating his view on women based on very little data. At best, you could say he was talking about women in BA being more selective. That alone doesn't necessarily imply one way or the other that women are being rudely selective or just \`selective\`.
> He‚Äôs still a misogynist though, right?

Where tf did i deny this

> Are you going to argue that him making that point refutes any other complaints though?

No, where did you get this from?

> Because bringing this up is otherwise just a red herring argument to distract from the point.

No, the other person brought it up first. I confirmed multiple times I agree with his point on the current comment.

How the fuck is that not enough and you still misinterpret me.
I‚Äôm not comparing creepiness, I‚Äôm saying a creepy guy and a severely overweight woman both struggle to find a partner. To be clear, if most passportbros hit the gym, have no body odor, and have a well kept haircut, they wouldn‚Äôt be a passport bro to begin üò¨
looking abroad for a girlfriend is not ‚Äúinherently‚Äù wrong if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into
I knew I never passed CS 70‚Ä¶
it's actually worse in context. the fact that he decided to continue such inappropriate discourse makes it even worse. i was providing the context because i thought it would highlight the toxicity even further.

instead of shutting it down, shewchuk went ""you see, the problem is bay area women""
i know what he said. it‚Äôs a terribly callous way to talk about your female ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. especially using words that usually refer to people dying‚Ä¶
> I feel weird about it, and I feel like, under your code of ethics, that's reason enough for you to stop doing it. Respect the way in which you're making me uncomfortable, violating social norms about afforded respects. I have, as you say, a right to deny your claim.

No where have I said people have a right to be comfortable. One has a right to call out untruths. Jonathan is Jonathan's name, and you are welcome to contest that if you have a counterargument. Feel free to convince me otherwise. How you feel about Jonathan's name being Jonathan and me using his name accurately is none of my concern.

> Additionally you are projecting the word **""all""** into this statement. 

The set of Women includes all women. The set of Women in the Bay Area include all women in the Bay Area. The set of people include all people. The set of Black People include all black people. This isn't projection, this is you being bad at formal logic. Jonathan is a smart man and is capable of making accurate statements, and if he fails to do so, people may call out his untruths. How *you* think it should be read and what it *actually says* diverges here, because you have demonstrated a poor understanding of sets, what they entail, and what that means in Jonathan's statement. There's nothing I can do about that. Unless you think the set of people only includes *some people* rather than *all people*, what you are saying is untenable.

Jonathan has said the set of Women in the Bay Area have a stark behavior difference than women elsewhere. Neither you or him are able to actually say what this behavior is, because we all know anything you say there would be a non-sense and inaccurate statement. Please tell me a single one of the 10 behaviors *you still have not named* that the Women of the Bay Area all commit that make them harder to date. Please, even one.
No he wasn't depressed. He specifically asked for a _dating advice_. Offering mental help in response to that I would consider to be a soft form of bullying.

Cool video btw, really appreciate.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be shocked by the stark differences in behavior of women‚Äù

This implies that there is something undesirable about the behavior of women here, where he says men shouldn‚Äôt date. If you are suggesting that the only difference in behavior that he is implying is selectivity, you are being disingenuous. 

‚ÄúBehave poorly‚Äù was the words I‚Äôm putting in his mouth, but to be more accurate I should have said ‚Äúbehave in a way that makes it so you should choose not to date them.‚Äù My way was shorter. Seems fair.
Yea a lot of people keep putting words in his mouth.
Eh, sorry, got so far down chain I didn‚Äôt put you as the guy that originally countered only exactly that comment‚Ä¶
Agree with the first point after your clarification 

Completely disagree with the second because a passport bro the passport bro because usually they‚Äôre socially weird and creepy, not because they‚Äôre overweight. The professor whose message was screenshotted is actually decent looking. If he had a good personality and wasn‚Äôt such a creepy incel he probably could have avoided the passport bro route
for OP, i mean, that kinda is the problem. do you think OP is going to have success with bay area women?  


so like, if op wants success, going somewhere else would work.  
it's the problem *for op.* i kinda think you're projecting when you just assume it's a moral indictment against you.
Yeah sure it's callous, but it's just some ""I don't understand interpersonal relationships in the conventional way and talk about them/understand them kind of weird"" autism shit. There's nothing in there harmful to women, it's just someone who's probably on the spectrum being on the spectrum.
uh huh. I've asked you to stop twice now and you've refused. If you deny that we work under the polite formalities I'm asking of you, then I'm gonna stop talking to you. I'm not asking much of you. That's rude, bordering on offensive. You're signaling to me that you're an untrustworthy conversation partner by ignoring my boundaries. Surely we both have an interest in good faith.

the set of women CAN, but *does not necessarily* include all women. I do not think Dr. Shewchuk was employing a mathematician's precision in crafting that statement. I find it highly unlikely that a man in his field would not conceive of exceptions. It should be read with the implied colloquial meaning, ""many, **or** most, and **up to** all, but **not necessarily** all."" wide range of options, there. the data is incomplete; the statement does not contain enough information to conclusively decide.

some of the ten behaviors that a young man might find makes it hard to date bay-area women, especially if he was, for example, me, include bay area ethics, bay area values, bay area political opinions, bay area physical health. Probably top among these would be the propensity for bay area people in general to lean towards ""call-outs,"" as evidenced herein, and a rather harsh attitude towards forgiveness of minor mistakes. 

but it doesn't have to be that. it could be anything. maybe Dr. Shewchuk finds it difficult to date people who smell like the ocean. Maybe he finds rich out-of-state transplants distasteful. You don't have to disprove these piece by piece. The point is that *you can't possibly know which it is, because you don't have enough information*. 

\> Jonathan has said the set of Women in the Bay Area have a stark behavior difference than women elsewhere. Neither you or him are able to actually say what this behavior is, because we all know anything you say there would be a non-sense and inaccurate statement.  


It seems like you're saying women of the bay area are exactly the same as women everywhere else in existence. I find that hard to believe. Examples: bay area women are starkly different from iraqis. Bay area women are starkly different from brazilian uncontacted tribeswomen. Bay area women are starkly different from women from Alabama. Bay area women are starkly different from Aleutian dog herders. Do I have to spell out the exact ways in which they're different? Don't you already know?
>Jonathan has said the set of Women in the Bay Area have a stark behavior difference than women elsewhere.

You're missing out the ending of his sentence which makes it clear he was making a demand/supply kind of statement: that women are more selective in this area because of the supposed gender imbalance. Read again more carefully where he said something alone the lines of ""stark difference in behavior of women here compared to elsewhere where there are more of them"".

Y'all hypothesizing this X factor that he implies all Bay Area women have is honestly laughable.
Or it could simply mean that women are more selective here. 

For example, saying there's a stark difference between the way Ivy League selects student vs. the way the rest of the colleges select student doesn't necessarily imply that the way Ivy League selects students is bad.

Not sure how I'm being disingenuous by not negatively interpreting his statements.
No problem. I understand how that can happen with reddit's ""view 1 more comment"" redirecting you to a whole new page
i think op has bigger issues than finding a gf. imo those issues would follow him wherever he went atm. ofc this is all just my opinion. 

and nah not really. if anything i feel like u guys are projecting your own personal feelings onto what was said. like so many people are saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs simple supply and demand‚Äù when he specifically said the problem was some vague ‚Äúbehavior of women‚Äù in the area, which includes probably hundreds of his students! 

he didn‚Äôt specify that his problem was women were too picky here, and he didn‚Äôt leave it at the idea that there aren‚Äôt as many women in this area.
those words promote a callous and thus toxic view of women. i'm not trying to lynch him, i'm simply pointing out the effects his words can have.
> If you deny that we work under the polite formalities I'm asking of you, then I'm gonna stop talking to you. I'm not asking much of you.
>  Surely we both have an interest in good faith.

Then you should be able to tell me the good faith reason I may not call someone by the name they are given, regardless how you feel about it. I'm not going to call someone else *not their name* because it makes you comfortable. Why then would I lend credence to the contrapositive? You may dictate your name to me. You do not get to dictate the names people give themselves. Jonathan has willingly called himself Jonathan, and I am doing the same. If you can communicate why you should have a sense of disapprobation of me doing this, I'm willing to listen. You haven't done so. I will continue calling him what he has listed as his name until such a time. If you are unwilling to communicate why this boundary exists, I'm unwilling to call someone by something other than their own-offered name for your sake. 

> the set of women CAN, but *does not necessarily* include all women.

Factually incorrect. Please learn logic.

> . It should be read with the implied colloquial meaning, ""many, **or** most, and **up to** all, but **not necessarily** all.""

Jonathan had the capacity to add any qualifiers he wishes to use. He did not do so, and statements may be taken as it is stated. The set of people is not ""many, **or** most, and **up to** all, but **not necessarily** all."" It includes all people. 

> bay area ethics, bay area values, bay area political opinions, bay area physical health. Probably top among these would be the propensity for bay area people in general to lean towards ""call-outs,"" as evidenced herein, and a rather harsh attitude towards forgiveness of minor mistakes. 

The set of Women in the Bay Area do not uniformly commit these actions. My counterargument is Jonathan's wife. Unless you believe she commits to callout culture, you are factually incorrect.

> It seems like you're saying women of the bay area are exactly the same as women everywhere else in existence. I

Please point to where I made this claim. Individuals have behaviors; collectives do not. I am saying one ought not attribute the action of the individual to the collective except in the case of bijection. A singular woman in the Bay Area and a singular woman in Iraq are likely different. You are correct. You know who else has different behaviors? Two women in the Bay Area.
Waiting u/zbignew 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This same thing is said to women in NYC. ""Leave NYC to date, men behave way differently outside of it"" (because there is a proportional abundance of women in NYC). This is not misandrist in the slightest.
[deleted]
Exactly what happened üòÇ
but he also didn't do the opposite, which means you can't decide either way. not beyond a hunch.
you're ignoring a very simple request to use professional titles instead of first names, and I no longer trust you. I'm not going to hear any more of your side. Goodbye.
Waiting? What are you waiting for? This isn‚Äôt a debate. 

By saying behavior, the clear implication is that they are behaving differently, in a way that means you should not date them, because they can get away with this behavior due to the power imbalance created by their scarcity. He‚Äôs not saying you shouldn‚Äôt date them because you won‚Äôt be selected. He‚Äôs saying you shouldn‚Äôt even date the ones that would select you, because they all behave some kind of way.

I didn‚Äôt further say anything is *wrong* with this statement. It‚Äôs just the plainest interpretation. You can dream in something he didn‚Äôt say about selectivity if you like, but you‚Äôre being dishonest if you say my interpretation doesn‚Äôt make perfect sense. 

Note that this comment is merely restating what I said in previous comments. Once I‚Äôve said that some position is plainly dishonest, when someone simply repeats that dishonesty, I don‚Äôt see how it contributes anything for me to respond. 

So, if you‚Äôre looking for some new insight from me, expect to keep waiting.
That's what he meant. You're acting as if people have to say what they meant literally. 

And no, saying there are more women in certain area doesn't mean he thinks of them as livestock.
Got it haha. Sorry for the strong words earlier, just had to defend myself
no, as i‚Äôve explained what he did say was actually problematic.
You are a person who cannot understand truth statements; what you consider trustworthy is dubious at best.
>By saying behavior, the clear implication is that they are behaving differently, 

Yes, in that they are more selective

>in a way that means you should not date them

&#x200B;

Err, no? Just that you \*can't\*. The ""plainest"" interpretation of ""behavior"" in the context of Shewchuk mentioning proximity to those cities with large male ratios is a reference to selectivity.
My words were just as aggressive friend, it was a fair and just defense.
you ""explained"" your opinion. you don't get to have a monopoly on truth and especially not on opinion, especially since you're wrong; you can't have it one way and not the other. either he specified, or he didn't. and he didn't specify. which means you can't extrapolate.
üëç I hope you enjoyed repeating ourselves again because I didn‚Äôt
lol that's not how words work. i dont want to write an essay but perhaps chatgpt can -- ""can implications be offensive"".
i will give you a point because that is a very funny way to dismiss an argument out of hand, and it made me laugh in spite of myself.

counter argument, what you're inferring may not necessarily be what was implied.
what i'm saying is without further specification, without inferring anything, his words were simply offensive. maybe you don't find them offensive personally, but obviously they were to many.
fair enough, we'll agree on that."

idk, in my experience the ""horny nerds"" trope seemed to ring true (more than a decade ago! wow!). I was not by any means an attractive man, in fact I was pretty average and unremarkable but it seemed many Cal women were very nice and open to giving me a chance.

Have things changed since covid? I've also seen the statistic about genz not having as much sex. Or is this just toxic Andrew Tate BS?

I moved from Toronto to South Bay in 2015 and while I still got dates, it was way harder to start a relationship here.

I dated for 4 months in Toronto before finding a girlfriend (we split 4 months later because of my move).

It then took me 3 YEARS(!!) to do the same thing here and required a lucky encounter with someone who literally had filed for divorce days earlier, and therefore hadn't been getting passed around on the apps. Also she was nearly a decade older than me (but still very attractive). Sadly after about 2 years she went cold/evil on me when she realized just how spoiled for choice she was (basically got cocky like most of the rest).

So yes, what the dude wrote is 100% accurate. Women can be SHOCKINGLY callous when they know you're easily replaceable.

Bay Area dating culture is incredibly difficult, but not for the reasons cited in these posts. Tech culture is prevalent, and many young people are extremely career driven. While this by itself is good for them, it leaves little time for getting to know others and/or spending with any one individual. If you're similarly occupied it may not be such an issue.
I'm gonna get downvoted but I got more matches my first week in Boston than i did 6-7 months in San Jose. It is absolutely significantly more difficult for young guys in the bay, regardless of what reddit insists.
Dating is hard everywhere, people in the bay just want to believe that it‚Äôs harder here, but plenty of people have success. I wouldn‚Äôt take it into account over things like quality of education or location. The west coast is lovely.
That's not the takeaway.
Only for these top dweebs who act like this and then wonder why they can‚Äôt meet women.
I live in Seattle and I don't like it here. It's kind of hard to make friends.
Yes

My dude.  It was a freakin‚Äô free for all in Berkeley and SF in the ‚Äò90s!  
I mean, were you going to lesbian bars and didn‚Äôt realize it?!
its really not that hard to not be creepy
How terrible for you that women aren't making themselves up just to get your attention and don't respond to you creeping on them in public places.  Oh woe is you!
He‚Äôs just super lonely and he‚Äôs paying people to just to meet them.¬†
I mean still pretty misogynistic or at least socially ignorant to think there's a set experation date for forming relationships. And also to lament losing out on one of the  ""expiring"" relationships, but also being the one who never texted back lol.
I don't think it's any more difficult. Berkeley maybe more than other universities due to the academics being tough and a priority. And if you work in tech and don't have other hobbies then the dating pool as a guy is tougher. 


But I think the dating scene has gotten tough everywhere ever since dating apps became so big. Everyone wants to find someone by swiping but then it's hard to get people to commit to in person meetups for the first time.

I've seen women say similar things to Shewchuk here about men all the time. ""Don't date X kind of person"", however they usually explain what exactly they mean rather than keep it vague. Like I heard a lot of people say that they wouldn't date men from Korea (not Koreans raised abroad, just Koreans from Korea proper) because of their experiences with them being overly controlling which seems to stem from the way men are raised there, or in other cases just because of cultural differences. It is unfair to Korean men who don't do those things and I don't think of it as a hard rule, but they make clear that it's these attitudes that make a relationship hard, not necessarily something inherent. 

It's still not right because people are not their culture, and they can change, but I think if Shewchuk said something like ""Don't bother with women in the Bay Area, they're focused on their careers and don't have much leftover to deal with your needs, your relationship will be more about how it reflects on them personally rather than about being there for you"", it wouldn't be... as controversial? I think people have encountered people like that before, so even if it might not be true for the group overall, people could understand it being common and could relate to him being so cynical. Like I remember reading a guy talk about how his girlfriend dumped him because he had a mental breakdown and couldn't continue his research job, instead of you know, being there for him and helping him (it was anonymized, but I don't think it was Berkeley). I think because he kept it vague, people projected a lot onto his comments especially in an environment where incel-like views are very common. 

To be clear, his comments are very weird, inappropriate and pointless, why he is giving comments about getting women instead of CS concerns, and it's possible they do have misogynistic views behind them, but that on their own they're very vague.
[deleted]
Huh?? Bay Area dating is terrible compared to Chicago, LA, or NYC. Heck, I would even put Austin above it.
Sad news bears
its not misogynistic , but an insane thing to say.
Hold up‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a young (I assume on gender identity here) woman and there are men your age turned off because you have a career now and/or don‚Äôt want to give it up to be Susie Homemaker?!!  Is it still 1955 in Texas?  

Wait - I know the answer.  Yes. Yes, it is.  

I mean, you‚Äôll find troglodytes here in CA as well, but not too many in the Bay in my experience (Cal grad, lifelong Bay Area resident).
then you're set lol
no it's 100% misogynistic, especially given the context
[deleted]
California for sure has more liberal views on relationships. Also it's expensive so unless one of you are a surgeon or a trust fund baby I think most people expect their partner to also work lol."
Thoughts on Passport Bros,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bmui46/thoughts_on_passport_bros/,2024-03-24 13:25:55,"Given the Jonathan Shewchuk‚Äòs comment on dating and women situation, I wanted to write out something that‚Äôs been on my mind. Jonathan‚Äôs comment is inappropriate and should not have been posted. Some comments mention he met his wife in an Asian country, probably why he suggests to date outside the Bay Area.

I myself am Asian, and partially was able to be born in the US because my uncle was an American who met my aunt in an Asian country.

My Uncle was an enlisted soldier in the Air Force. He‚Äôs quite cool, he looks like Doc Brown from Back to the Future and is pretty funny. He met my aunt on a deployment, and they dated and got married.

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: my uncle sponsored my aunt‚Äôs green card. Then my aunt sponsored my grandmother‚Äôs green card. Then my grandmother sponsored my dad‚Äôs green card. Unfortunately that got stuck in limbo due to a 1989 situation. My dad did undergrad and graduate school in the US so was later able to get work based green card sponsorship, but it did set back his immigration plans several years. Finally, my dad sponsored my mom‚Äôs green card, and I was born in the US. This is my dilemma, I likely wouldn‚Äôt have been born in the US if my uncle didn‚Äôt married my aunt from an Asian country. They do have a 10-15 year age gap, which is weird, but they‚Äôre also still together after multiple decades. My cousin is also pretty cool.

It‚Äôs true some people go date in other countries because they get rejected in their own country, but is that necessarily a bad thing? Sometimes it is just a visa marriage, but other times it‚Äôs a lovely marriage like my uncle and aunt. There‚Äôs also a power dynamic issue, the citizen has all the power in a visa based marriage, and can mistreat their partner. I guess it has good and bad.

Jonathan‚Äòs comments were wildly inappropriate but I‚Äôd like to provide my perspective why I think dating in other countries, commonly associated with Passport Bros, isn‚Äôt always a bad thing.","I think there‚Äôs a big difference between the situation you describe and the ‚Äúpassport bro‚Äù idea. It sounds like your uncle happened to be in a foreign country, met someone, and got married. I think what people find so creepy/predatory about the passport bros idea is that they‚Äôre going to foreign countries EXCLUSIVELY to meet women who need them financially. So while it‚Äôs true that the power dynamic you mention can happen organically/healthily, people are disturbed by the idea of SEEKING OUT that dynamic for its own sake.
Lowkey i think if they were chill ppl wouldn't care. His facebook is just hella weird and in combination with the ed comment it's a really bad look. She also looks like half his age if not more.
You situation is different than an older male going to PI/Thailand simply for a younger female.

Unfortunately the story doesn't end well when the spouse migrates...
it's good to reflect on why you're not able to attract women without offering them advantages like green card - could reveal an issue with yourself
I already know ur filipino by this post lol üòÇ
His comment itself was not inappropriate but the place of his comment may have been, The only people who found his comment inappropriate were people who simply either don‚Äôt like him or didn‚Äôt like what he said(No brainer), He didn‚Äôt use any inappropriate language or say anything explicit, I wish people would stop commenting about this as it is not that big a deal but it is because he is a professor ü§¶üèø
Just move

Women are different elsewhere

They value men
People cope about passport bros because they still have the small/isolated town mentality where you can't exactly leave without immense risk. 

Western men aren't entitled to western women and vice versa. A bottle of water is a dollar at the supermarket and six dollars at the airport, one should go where he/she is valued.
Valid point, that‚Äôs a big difference in this case
Yea he's about 50. She's about 21..
The place was 100% inappropriate for that type of comment
‚ÄúThe only people who found his comment inappropriate were those who‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt like what he said‚Äù

What are you trying to say here? ‚ÄúInappropriate‚Äù doesn‚Äôt just mean ‚Äúhas a swear in it‚Äù; I think everyone is on the same page that people are saying the content of his statement was the problem

Just confused what you mean
Do you even go here üíÄ
If true she‚Äôs the age of a good portion of his students that‚Äôs fucking crazy
Proof?
Even if there‚Äôs no Swearing, It still wasn‚Äôt inappropriate ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è People just want a reason to try and cancel someone, if it was a ordinary person nobody would be talking this much but since it‚Äôs a professor it‚Äôs all of sudden a problem.

This is just cringe. How can your first response from someone originally expressing their interests and frustrations with their major be about your (or lack thereof) ""date"" life? Objectifying women and saying that those in the Bay Area are inferior is fucking sad man. What's your view of the world? Get help. Both the Prof and Peter.

Terms like ""plentiful"" and ""expire"" make me recoil in embarrassment.
such a bad apology. essentially says he was misogynistic because he wanted to sympathize?? sure he didn't 'mean to convey' any disrespect for women but doesnt change the fact he seems like he stands by what he said and isn't walking back or clarifying any of his comments
bullshit apology
""I did not mean to convey any disrespect for women"" ‚Äì yikes, ground your apology in the impact not the intent, especially when there's a power imbalance involved in the people harmed
Getting invested and I don‚Äôt even go to this uniüò≠
Most pathetic and half-hearted apology. He should be ashamed of himself, and the Department even more so if they don‚Äôt take strong action.
[deleted]
he's a passport bro, check his FB before he innevitably hides it
Dude is full of shit
""I'm sorry that your feelings were hurt""
WTF. This professor's language indicates a person who thinks of women as a commodity (""plentiful women""??). What sort of professor could imagine that comment is remotely OK, especially in an academic discussion space? Weak apology too. Looks like incel culture has a home at Cal's CS department.
‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry you felt that way‚Äù
Textbook example of a non-apology apology.
This is the worst apology to ever be put out. He takes no accountability for what he said, he‚Äôs trying to excuse it as a reach for sympathy. ‚ÄúIt starts with empathy for each other‚Äù how about u start by seeing women as people and not as objects to ‚Äúget‚Äù.
I somehow agree with the ‚Äòcommon knowledge‚Äô that it‚Äôs hard to find a gf in the Bay Area, but I believe the problem w dating is that male to female ratio in those high-tech companies is nearly 2:1 and those women are highly educated enough to despise men like this Jonathan S.

100% agree with him. Finding a good marry able native bay area woman is harder than finding an honest politician.¬†


My wife and i are 23+ years into our marriage and i dated her because i got sick of California girls in the 90s, dating only immigrants and finally marrying one of them.
not on women's history month
This is an atrocious apology
To err is human; to forgive, divine Machine Learning !
He can go fuck himself with a sharp stick.
classy response tbf. think we should regd this as a teaching moment...have heard much more inflammatory things in humanities classes.
His apology doesn't address people's real concern: a person who holds his attitudes can't be a fair teacher. Students depending on mentoring and recommendations for jobs and research posts. 

Besides the fact that of course he intended to convey disrespect for women ‚Äî don't tell us you don't know what words mean. Don't piss on us and tell us it's raining. 

That line about empathy is particularly galling. Everyone was showing empathy until Shewchuk came along. Where was Shewchuk's empathy for women? He's got his nerve lecturing people about being empathetic.
The Professor was correct.

Unless you are looking for a wife with a penis?
Professor is right. Bay Area women are some of the worst. Travel the world and see for yourself. I mean, just travel the US alone and you can see the same. The men too for that matter. Bunch of entitled self-important folk.
Hi Professor Shewchuk,

Most people (including myself) feel you did nothing wrong by stating your opinion. Many of us who discussed this post are CAL alum and feel this is overreach by administration.  We are also discouraged about the thought of students/faculty/staff not being about to state a reasonable opinion without interference. It's not helpful to students to condition them to be porcelain or fragile in a world where voices of reason are needed. In sum, utilizing the notion of offense undermines the dialectical in public discourse and we need to move past this currently supported stance of 'being offended' as it is a form of manipulation whose primary purpose is power hustling. It also kills any potential comedic value.
Spineless non-apology tbh
Very poor apology
this is the ugliest apology ive ever seen in my entire life
Reddit randomly shows me stuff from this sudreddit. 

What the post he is apologizing for?
thats a wilbur soot level apology right there
I had an iota of sympathy for the professor but as soon as I found out about his mail-order bride, I could see how he sees (and is threatened) by empowered caucasian, Hispanic, or black Bay Area women.

He is a poster child for the Bay Area Incel Club(BAIC). 
This dude has no game even in places like Sacramento or Fresno. No wonder he went to the Philippines to get a wife half of his age.
He was based before apologizing.
Poor guy, trying to save his job. I hate how one can be totally honest and be considered offensive. It does suck being a heteromale in the Bay, you can use math to back it up which he did. He did his students a favor. Women have obsurd standards across the board and will judge you for the most trivial reasons. They can simply move on to the next because the options are many. Berkeley is a liberal fantasy land. I am disappointed in this place even more.
I am not even Berkeley student and close-watching this salty shit drama lmao
I totally agree with this guy! If you want to find decent women/people get out of the bay area..
I mean, he's 100% correct and anyone attacking him is beyond cracked in the head and needs a serious values check. Maybe some of you are mad about that but I don't really care, and neither should this professor. My recommendation would be to pound sand and have a cry about it and get over it.
He shouldn‚Äôt apologize. ¬†He‚Äôs right! ¬†Btw, what happened to freedom of speech? ¬†Diversity of thought? ¬†
There is a reason why passport bros is a real thing. I've been married to an immigrant for 24 years. Best decision I made in my life.
I dont even go to berkeley I go to usc but damn I could not imagine any of the cs professors ive had saying anything like this‚Ä¶ definitely a culture thing at berkeley

He‚Äôs based af.
he can't empathize with women, since he identifies as a Smith and Wesson.
He‚Äôs married to a Philippine woman.
and he says he didnt ""mean"" to blame women but literally said the problem w dating is ""the behavior of women"" how tf else is that supposed to be interpreted... talk all you want about how you didn't mean to offend, but if you're gonna say that shit better just own up to it. i guess it's sympathizing with a student if your idea of sympathy is feeding into open misogyny
>this is just based

FTFY.


>How can your first response from someone originally expressing their interests and frustrations with their major be about your (or lack thereof) ""date"" life?¬†

He‚Äôs married to a superior Philippine woman. Look up his profile (or just see all the other comments here talking about it).

>Objectifying women and saying that those in the Bay Area are inferior is fucking sad man.¬†

He‚Äôs right, the Bay Area is full of worthless ‚Äúpeople‚Äù. Cry more lmao.
Ah, the classic ""sorry **you** were offended and mistook my words. TwaS OnlY tRyiNg to heLp.

> You'll be shocked by the stark differences in behavior of women in places where women are plentiful versus their behavior within artillery distance of San Jose and San Francisco.

Man, sit your ass down LMAO. And he wants to go all let's sing kumbaya and ""*I have empathy for all*"" tacked on in the end.

This fugger's closer to Elliot Rodger speak than someone who should be lecturing students at a University.
sorry, this is a genuine question, how was his reply misogynistic? it‚Äôs very unprofessional to be posted on Ed, but misogynistic?
True, he should not have apologized.
Except he actually DID intend to disrespect women. You don't pull the ""behavior"" sentence out of your ass without intent. 

Nobody's going to fire him.  Because nobody in the CS dept gives a flying fuck about women.
You know what? Every human being should be invested in this. This is the kind of insidious and non-insidious shit that's just one big shit stew climate of hate.  And fuck UCB if they keep him on.
Don't think they will do anything beyond maybe trainings. What I do hope is that non-tenured teaching staff who spoke out against this will be protected from professional retaliation.
Only pathetic thing is that he apologized.
He may be book smart, but definitely not common sense smart, especially if people can obtain that much OSINT about him.
>marries a non-white woman

‚Äúomg he a passport bro!‚Äù

Your tears make good lubricant. Nobody picked you because of your trash personality, not your race.
Smart guy
People always say ‚Äúplenty of fish in the sea‚Äù. You are nitpicking because you are assblasted by his comment.
Like to me to it just says that it‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs enough women it‚Äôs just that you‚Äôre too immature and bigoted for women to like you lmao like??
He‚Äôs married to a Philippine woman, which assrapes your little narrative.

big yikes.  but people do be passport bro'ing to get a wife.
Can I get the backstory/details here? I need to know more about this wife situation because what the fuck üíÄüíÄ.
I too want more backstory. I FBd him and found his/his wifes FB but OP do you know more? Like her age and such
sorry if my comment came off as insensitive, i totally see why it could be taken like that. i didn't mean to be racist to his wife, if she happens to be in a happy marriage, im happy for her.

is there a chance that shewchuck was on vacation in the philipines, and happened to meet and fall in love with his wife? yea. but what's far more likely, given his comments about 'bay area women' that pretty much echo passport bro beliefs, is that he was a rich american who went to a poorer country and picked out a much younger girl for the sake of marriage.

this behavior is fucked up and exploitative, and its even more fucked up when this rich american happens to be in an esteemed faculty position where he is not only teaching hundreds of women, but almost encouraging this behavior to his male students
this needs to be talked about cuz wtf it‚Äôs actually real
What's the problem with that
And that when you say ""the behavior of women"" it's pretty fucking clear that you intended disrespect, too.

This is like when kids taunt each other while pretending they aren't egging each other on. Yeah, yeah, Upchuck. The women just walked right into your fist.
There are things which are appropriate for authority figures at school/work to say & things that are not. This falls in the ‚Äòare not bucket‚Äô. Professors should know the boundaries of what‚Äôs acceptable to say in a public forum.
Do not confuse 'empowered' with 'entitled,' there is a difference.
Don't worry. It's not that easy to get rid of a tenured professor in CA.
I was thinking the exact same thing. It‚Äôs shocking to me how few people seem to understand this. 

His apology in particular (focusing on his intentions instead of his impact) is strongly characteristic of someone on the spectrum. 

I think it‚Äôs important to recognize that and acknowledge his disability, because it adds context to how he can lack awareness and offend so many people. He is human and it is likely he is not nearly as terrible of a person as everyone here thinks.
sounds like someone who grew up with no positive role models & love in his life
Never read it huh?
1984 is when you apologize, and not even well

i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just about your looks buddy

You can walk in into any lecture, the campus is public and nobody would even know if you are even a student

Calling out the Bay Area women for being repulsive blue hairs isn‚Äôt ‚Äúblaming all women‚Äù. He himself is married to a woman from the Philippines. The only reason to get assblasted about his comment is if you are one of the people he was talking about.
He‚Äôs married to a Philippine woman. His comments making your anus bleed doesn‚Äôt make him ‚Äúcloser to a mass murderer‚Äù. Your tears make good lubricant.
I think people are saying it was misogynistic because his reply seemed to imply that there is something wrong with women in the Bay Area.
He blamed women for an individual‚Äôs personal problems. It‚Äôs also just an unhelpful response because it discourages young people from acknowledging what they can improve about themselves.
what could Shewchuk do to them?
Tianze?
He‚Äôs married to a Philippine woman, which assrapes your little narrative.
Well, I do know about this. It's just that no matter how educated men or women are, there must be some who can‚Äôt tell good or bad.

Gonna cry?
You‚Äôre right. We should leave his wife alone, they could be completely happy, there‚Äôs no reason to blindly believe he coerced her. 

But after his response, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Seems like he was speaking from experience, and he had no luck with women in the Bay Area so he went to ‚Äúwhere women are plentiful‚Äù because of the ‚Äústark difference in behavior‚Äù. Imagine being his wife and reading a comment like that‚Ä¶ his reply really just puts his own relationship in a different context and it‚Äôs not a good one. 

You‚Äôre right though leave the wife alone! I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs a nice lady I just feel bad for her after this.
Yep. All these people jumping in to judge a married couple they know nothing about.
i mean she also looks at least 20 years younger than him. i don't really care, more power to them, and honestly if you're gonna marry for status/money/first world citizenship you could do a lot worse than a berkeley professor. but you gotta admit it's a little sus lol.
Asian women always manage to pick the best white guys LMAO
It's not about him being white it's about him being 50
No woman would marry that man out of anything except sheer desperation. Get real.
Not saying I would be surprised but I think people just say this shit because she's from the Philippines
His FB is still public as of now. Couldn‚Äôt find her age anywhere

Edit. His cover photo is literally her selfie EwwwwwüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
lol plug the FBs I'm curious
It‚Äôs worth noting that a common sentiment among incels/mgtow types is that women in Asia make better wives because they are more submissive/feminine/wifely and haven‚Äôt been corrupted by Western feminism.

This does not mean that this was the case here. But spend a few minutes in any incel forum and you‚Äôll see this shit right out in the open.
Exactly. In a vaccum, sure, we shouldn't make assumptions like that. But given the misogyny he already displayed, it's way more likely
> but what's far more likely, given his comments about 'bay area women' that pretty much echo passport bro beliefs, is that he was a rich american who went to a poorer country and picked out a much younger girl for the sake of marriage.

""Sorry if my comment came off as insensitive, but I'm going to double down on it based on a single data point and a fuck-ton of my own pre-existing beliefs and blatant specultation that I'm giong to pass off as common sense.""
Y'all he's just preparing women in stem for corporate culture bullshit üòÇüò≠ü§Æ
These guys think ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù is when you simply are never held accountable for any wrongdoing. It is not wrong to uphold a certain standard of etiquette for professors, particularly when that standard ensures a genuinely fair and safe work and school environment.
it was clear the person he was responding to was really struggling mentally. sometimes some genuine advice doesn't hurt. sad how male mental health is disregarded
Is the dept perfect? Hell no. Do the vast majority of folks actually care about, disabled and BIPOC students? Yes. 

Do we have a shit ton of work to keep at and would I like to see more support from others? Yes and yes.
Well, they're not doing anything about it and actions speak louder than words, so...
üòÇ
I've seen a lot of comments like this and I think they are way too charitable of an interpretation. There is an incredibly obvious difference between saying ""dating competition is steep due to gender ratios"" and ""dating is hard due to the behavior of \[gender group\] in \[area\]."" Not to mention the former isn't even true on Berkeley campus. Stop playing dumb
Is it okay to think that there is something wrong with both men and women in the bay area?
Saying something is wrong with women in the Bay Area is not misogynistic because it's not denigrating women, it's denigrating the Bay Area
No, he blamed bay area women's culture.
im 100% with you on how Professor is redirecting the issue off of the OP onto their partner of choice. That is very inappropriate and wrong (even beyond projecting his unprofessional thoughts onto Ed). But when I imagine replacing women with ""men"", I don't see this being misandrist at all, just a distaste for Bay Area culture and how that dictates gender behaviors
If he's + others who think he's been wrong here are on hiring committees, vote against those teaching staff being rehired.
Que?
Ariel.

But why is it relevant to post here?
Nah, it‚Äôs just stupid and gets posted in every single comment section
>Imagine being his wife and reading a comment like that‚Ä¶ his reply really just puts his own relationship in a different context and it‚Äôs not a good one.

Meh. A woman could say the same thing about guys in the Bay Area. ""With men so outnumbering women, it was so easy to find a guy willing to get in a committed relationship"".   It's really not that insulting.

Dude can‚Äôt get a wife/gf in the Bay Area. ‚ÄúHaha, what a loser, have sex incel.‚Äù He goes and tries his luck elsewhere, marries someone. ‚ÄúWait, no, not like that.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bit racist to assume that women in foreign countries don‚Äôt have agency and the marriage can not be consensual.
disregarding incel behavior isn‚Äôt disregarding male mental health! shocker!

get a reality check ASAP

also, defending incels/incel behavior is literally crazy?? hello??
His response was the worst response you can give to someone struggling mentally. Blaming other people for your own personal problems discourages personal introspection. It means that you will never attempt to work on your problems because you believe it‚Äôs out of your control. But it‚Äôs not true. I see way to many guys out there that you would call ugly and they have girlfriends.

A professor should never be discouraging their students from taking personal responsibility.
Professors and staff can see who made these anonymous posts in the forum.
He literally could‚Äôve reached out to this person in private, and recommended he get mental health help,
[deleted]
Is that what he said
Not necessarily, but it wouldn‚Äôt automatically be sexist.
That would be a stupid generalization
It is misogynistic because it generalizes a group of women as being ‚Äúlower quality‚Äù
Sorry but you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúswitch‚Äù the genders and assume that the greater context of the statement will remain the same. Our society feels it is appropriate to openly hate women for not fitting into certain gender roles well enough (aka women being ‚Äútoo‚Äù independent, assertive, loud, or even expecting a certain standard of treatment from men). When he refers to the behavior of women, he isn‚Äôt speaking about any wrongdoing women have taken part in. He‚Äôs speaking on a ‚Äúpersonality of woman‚Äù here that challenges their proper role or place in society and in relationships. We aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbehaving‚Äù and now he feels it‚Äôs right to openly disparage us, because men constantly feel the need to do so. 

Now if you were to switch the genders in that statement, everything that I just said would no longer apply. Instead, it would seem that we‚Äôd be discussing the well-documented misogynistic and discriminatory behaviors of men in Silicon Valley. And that is not inherently a misandristic statement. 

But funnily enough, I don‚Äôt think a female professor would ever say anything like that. That says a lot. Why are men so comfortable saying this?
nvm, guessed wrong.
I think yellow would be east asian, and they are not poor enough to be mail order

‚ÄúIncels‚Äù are men too and the majority of them have mental health problems that are disregarded
clearly shewchuk sympathizes with this man, and no one would reveal him to the general public. Worse case scenario he would get kicked out of the class, or dropped a letter grade. Not exposed to 10k+ people as an ""incel"".
Lmao. If that's what he meant, then he could have said that. But he didn't. It seems like to you, the words people choose don't have meaning
He was basically saying Bay Area women are uppity when he was blaming it on the ""behavior of women."" Calling women ""plentiful,"" like food or meat, is gross.
If he posts that men within artillery range are also not good to date, would he be okay then?
Where does it imply that they're lower quality? 

It sounds to me like he's saying that bay area women have more market power (because of the gender ratio), and he's recommending going somewhere they have less market power like NYC.
Attacking a group of women isn‚Äôt hating all women, my assblasted friend. He‚Äôs married to a Philippine girl.
Due to the fact that they live in the Bay Area, not that they are women. Presumably Shewchuk has no problem with the women in Seattle, New York, Shreveport, LA, or any other place in the world.
Did he call them lower quality?  Or did he imply their standards are too high?
You're adding a lot that wasn't part of the original statement. Maybe he meant Bay area women are so awesome that the student wouldn't have a chance with any of them?
>Sorry but you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúswitch‚Äù the genders and assume that the greater context of the statement will remain the same.¬†

Because you are mentally diseased and can‚Äôt see your brainwashing.

‚ÄúOur society feels it is appropriate to openly hate women for not fitting into certain gender roles well enough (aka women being ‚Äútoo‚Äù independent, assertive, loud, or even expecting a certain standard of treatment from men).‚Äù

No one hates a woman simply for being ‚Äúindependent‚Äù. But when she soergs out and blames men for all her issues, or acts as a POS, she cannot use her vagina card to deflect criticism. You can see how reddit screeches whenever JK Rowling says anything.

‚ÄúWhen he refers to the behavior of women, he isn‚Äôt speaking about any wrongdoing women have taken part in.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything at all. The insecurity of (some) of them said it all.

>He‚Äôs speaking on a ‚Äúpersonality of woman‚Äù here that challenges their proper role or place in society and in relationships.

Being a mentally ill blue hair isn‚Äôt something to be proud of.

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbehaving‚Äù and now he feels it‚Äôs right to openly disparage us, because men constantly feel the need to do so.‚Äù

So that‚Äôs why your asshole is split open. Because you are one of them.

‚ÄúNow if you were to switch the genders in that statement, everything that I just said would no longer apply. Instead, it would seem that we‚Äôd be discussing the well-documented misogynistic and discriminatory behaviors of men in Silicon Valley. And that is not inherently a misandristic statement.‚Äù

Guys like Elon Musk get attacked all the time.

‚ÄúBut funnily enough, I don‚Äôt think a female professor would ever say anything like that.‚Äù
Gender studies professors openly blame men for all their problems, my buttblasted friend.
‚ÄúThat says a lot. Why are men so comfortable saying this?‚Äù
Because he is correct.
Maybe I am living in a completely different culture bubble from you but I've not felt today's Bay Area of being tolerable of a society that you just described. I am honestly very curious on if you have any anecdotes or data that you can shows me that our society today ""feels like it's appropriate to openly hate women"". 

You view whatever men/white people say with the most uncharitable lens and you frame their sentences in downright bad faith. The whole point is that it's silly to even generalize and view Bay Area women as a monolithic group of rowdy, masculine, independent, high standard/demand humans (which is the what people are thinking Professor is implying). But instead of doing better than Professor, you do the same silly mistake and fall to the same intellectual pitfall, ""because men constantly feel the need to do so"" ""why are men so comfortable saying this?"" and go ahead and make this into some dumb gender war. The lack of self awareness is pretty amazing.

And if you're working in the framework of it's impossible to be a misandrist or have a misandrist ideologue because you live in a patriarchal society, then I can respect that. But I don't, and we can agree to disagree. To be clear, I am all for equity and so I do think misogyny is much more prevalent and much more of a problem that needs to be addressed.
there is no healthy way to deal with someone who vehemently blames women for their own lack of sex 

incels get 0 sympathy from me  üôè
mental health problems aren‚Äôt a free ticket to be sexist scumbags, sorry :/
it's not women's job to baby men. mental health issues are not an excuse to treat people poorly.
They are not representative of regular men. They are not representative of most men that have mental health problems.
If he had originally said that as well, yes, it would have made the takeaway very different
If he only said it about men?

I‚Äôd personally think it‚Äôs still kind of wack, especially given the context it was said in 

It would be construed differently though by a lot of people
Read deeper in the thread, I explain there. Also treating dating like an economic exchange is a reason why a lot of dudes can‚Äôt get dates
Dude, why are you defending this guy?

Your comment literally contradicts itself. The second sentence openly acknowledges his comment was being derisive of women in the Bay Area, while your first claims ""it's due to the fact they are in the Bay Area"". Notably he did not denigrate men in the Bay Area, so it's pretty fucking hard to see how it's not misogynistic

So, tl;dr, you're a fucking idiot who is backing a misogynist for no reason, which means you're a misogynist too. Be better.
He probably does, since women in Seattle and LA are culturally similar
He implied they behave poorly, which would make them a lower quality person
Lol
Making any kind of generalization is not inherently an intellectual pitfall. Generalization is necessary in conversation, how else do we discuss large-scale issues? Misogyny is a well-documented, large-scale issue that is upheld by men (and women who have internalized misogyny) in society. Misogyny from men is well-documented in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley. His issue isn‚Äôt only that he made a generalization, his issue is that the implications of that generalization are deeply problematic. 

I don‚Äôt need to give you an anecdote. There are mountains of data on the various ways women are degraded in our culture. Berkeley itself has acknowledged that the EECS department has an issue with mistreating women. I don‚Äôt need to prove this very blatant issue to you.
[At what point does this graduate from being solely an incel issue](https://i.redd.it/kan5bvz6kjz81.jpg)
Well, like it or not, the dating market is in fact a market. We have humans choosing between choices in their own self-interest, and economists have studied it extensively.

Going through your other replies, it seems like you're trying to inject moral judgement where there is none. Science focuses on how the world is, not how it should be.

A ""shocking"" result is an unexpected result and nothing more. Variable A has a stronger correlation with Variable B than hypothesized. It is not a judgement on what Variable B should be.

Finally, the advice given is also amoral. It takes the world as it is, not how it should be and tells him how to improve his odds. It's no different from [Date-Onomics](https://www.amazon.com/Date-onomics-Dating-Became-Lopsided-Numbers-ebook/dp/B00U0OBRT4) telling women in NYC to move to Seattle or the Bay Area.
Leftist men are more single. Statistically speaking.
What? Men were never relevant to the conversation because the student was complaining about not being able to get a girlfriend.
I don't think he implied they behaved poorly?  Where did you get poorly from?  I think he implied they behave in a way that someone with high standards would in Bay Area and in a way someone with lower standards would in a different area.
Your comment and now this reply were written so thoughtfully. Out of all the comments I've read, I feel that yours has really summed up what the issues are with the professors comment's.
ok bruh this data is literally buttcheeks and doesn‚Äôt support your point very well at all. 

anyways, womp womp don‚Äôt use bad graphics
Anything can be studied as a science, but how you approach dating (outside of studying it) affects whether you get a partner or not. And if you‚Äôre not seeing any moral judgement in what he said then you should work on your reading comprehension
Then why wouldn't the prof have said ""everyone in the Bay Area"" instead of just women? Because your weak ass deflection makes no sense? Gotcha
If he just meant that they have higher standards, he would have said that, and not made vague generalizations about shocking behavior. If he recommends someone avoid a group because of their behavior, then the implication is that their behavior is poor. Interpret it how you want though
Notice that I didn't even make a point, you just decided to lash out upon seeing that graph and directly copy/paste a talking point from the comments.

At least to start with, what proportion of those who have sex as minors just stop after they turn 18?

Even if this proportion is high, what can you make of the recent change?
If he said ""shocking behavior"" I would agree with you.


He didn't.  He said you'd be shocked by the stark difference in behavior.  How does that imply their behavior is poor or shocking?  It implies the difference is night and day, not that night or day is bad.  But I respect your opinion so feel free to let me know what you think of that.
I appreciate that you‚Äôre passionate about male virginity. Makes for a good icebreaker!
If the difference in behavior between group A and B is shocking, then it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that the behavior of group A is shocking to group B. And if he tells someone to avoid the ‚Äúnight‚Äù, he‚Äôs making a judgement on it
I'm also very passionate about male porn addiction, it's my go-to elevator pitch when talking to girls

lmao dickhead
Yes it‚Äôs shocking to group B, but that‚Äôs because Group A isn‚Äôt used to it, not because there‚Äôs something wrong with the behavior.


If I were to talk about the difference in the way Group A Americans act in public and the way Group B Japanese act in public, bowing, always ordered on escalators, always carrying trash across the city, does that degrade the behavior of Group A American culture where we don‚Äôt do those things?
If you‚Äôre telling people to avoid American culture, then yes
Why are people not allowed to prefer Japanese culture?
I didn‚Äôt say that
I think I see what you mean now.  It‚Äôs ok to say you prefer Japanese culture, you just shouldn‚Äôt say to avoid American culture?


If so, I guess I don‚Äôt really see the big deal.  Honestly a lot of foreigners talk a lot of shit about Americans and I think it‚Äôs fine.
Yeah pretty much. Saying ‚Äúavoid Americans because their behavior is shocking/poor‚Äù is an unintelligent generalization, whereas ‚ÄúI like Japanese cultural norms more than American cultural norms‚Äù doesn‚Äôt vilify anyone. FWIW I agree that a skewed gender ratio will lead to one gender having higher standards and pickier behavior generally, but to frame it solely as a problem with female behavior is ignorant of the bigger picture, ignores the man‚Äôs responsibilities, and is quite similar to the incel rhetoric of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get laid because women bad‚Äù, not to mention wildly inappropriate for a CS academic forum. And if a woman instructor said something like this about bay area men it would be stupid as well.
Honestly I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an unintelligent generalization, I think it‚Äôs an intelligent generalization.  America has unique problems with their culture, whether that be gun culture like the guy shooting the sky on campus a couple weeks ago, Christian extremism like the people that proselytize on campus, and general disrespect that you just don‚Äôt see in many other countries.  I don‚Äôt mind being called out on it and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt prefer it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt get that message across.  I don‚Äôt think that means they‚Äôre implying Americans are bad people, but i don‚Äôt care if people think it‚Äôs a culture that should be avoided.
I guess we have different thresholds for intelligent critique. Carry on homie
Carry on, I found your comments enlightening food for thought"
Status of CS182 for Spring 2022?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qdpj9r/status_of_cs182_for_spring_2022/,2021-10-22 13:28:27,What's the chances they offer this course?  The tentative CS schedule shows Jonathan Shewchuk as the professor.  This seems unlikely since he's teaching 189.  Are they still looking for someone to teach it or is it definitely not being taught in the spring.,"I think he taught two courses last spring
According to the EECS 101 Piazza, logistics are being finalized and the plan is to open enrollment sometime today.
It's open now and it's being taught by Marvin Zhang.
for you all interested in 182, have you taken 189 already? I want to take the class but I haven't taken 189
It's open now

thanks!"
<3 Shewchuk for being a reasonable and accommodating professor,https://i.redd.it/4au90jq9n6pa1.png,2023-03-21 17:11:53,,"What‚Äôd he do?
Shewchuk is üêê
wholesome post ü•π
Shewchuk is such a great professor and a person in general that he just makes me feel like I walked into some otome game and was subsequently forced into questioning my sexuality.

But then my horrible math drags me back to reality where I probably struggle to get above 20% on the midterm. I‚Äôve never really nailed any math courses, but doing bad in his 189 just makes me feel SO EXTRA bad. He‚Äôs as good a professor as you can ask for, but that just reemphasizes how much of a shame you are in his course - because you are the sole reason you are failing to learn. I hope I get to take his course again when I get better at math.
He is a great prof just his voice is supercalm(I believe he has articles for public speaking), I cant stop imagining he is my surgeon who conducts brain surguries on me everytime when I watch lectures...üôàüôàüôà

"Course Reviews Spring 2022, CS 161, CS 162, CS 188, CS 189",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/upa9fj/course_reviews_spring_2022_cs_161_cs_162_cs_188/,2022-05-13 22:23:07,"Doing reviews for the Undergrad Systems + AI speed run

CS 161 (Nicholas Weaver):

Rating: 9/10

Workload: \~4-5 hr/week, \~15hr/week when project 2 was being implemented

Pros:

* I found the content very interesting. It opened my eyes to a lot of security vulnerabilities and even improved how I approach my own personal security (security keys anyone?).
* Weaver was very passionate about the material (especially crypto) and  was a fantastic lecturer overall. If you read this post, best of luck being the CEO, Janitor, and Chief Mad Scientist of Skerry Technologies!
* Projects 1 & 2 are some of the coolest projects I've had to do for a class here. In Project 1, I felt like I was a hacker hacking into old decommissioned Gobian Union satellites. I thought the lore added some character from the otherwise same old same old CS project requirements (although obviously not required).
* For Project 2, I loved the systems design with security component of it. I found developing Project 2 very rewarding, as I not only learned Go, but I had practice applying a ton of the cryptographic primitives learned in class.

Cons:

* While there was an attempt to perhaps make how they are assigning grades more transparent, I felt that the binned grading scheme caused a good bit of stress for me. I think the bins are currently set unreasonably high, and there is a rumor that the bins will be shifted. I personally prefer a curve where you can estimate your position than unreasonably high bins with possibility (but not necessarily guaranteed) of a downward shift.

Overall, I strongly recommend any EECS/CS major to take CS161. It is super fun and the work around Project 2 can be managed.

CS 162 (John Kubiatowicz and Anthony Joseph)

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: \~20 hr/week

Pros:

* Content is generally really interesting and very helpful in understanding systems.
* Working within an existing codebase like Pintos was initially rough, but it ended up becoming rewarding, as you end up seeing how so many of the core OS functions are implemented.
* Design documents and design reviews force you to actually think about all sorts of aspects integrating features into a large codebase. I think my systems design skills definitely improved by the end of the course.
* Both Professor Kubi and Joseph are solid lecturers! I highly recommend them.

Cons:

* I think at some point there was a Homework, Project, Design Document, and Midterm in the span of 2.5 weeks. I wished the workload was more distributed or that the deadlines were spaced out better.
* Workload around project due dates was very high (almost like a full time job), but this could have been mitigated through better time management.
* Good group is an absolute must (or enjoy having your back broken)! I was fortunate to have a great group and I survived.

Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in becoming a SWE or who has an interest in systems.

CS 189 (Jonathan Shewchuk)

Rating: 8/10

Workload: \~10-12 hrs per week

Pros:

* I've been slow to pick up ML before due to the heavy math and I wasn't able to learn effectively from online resources. This class definitely pushed me over this hump, and now I find ML very exciting.
* I think Shewchuk's iteration has the right amount of theory to the point where I can understand the intuition for the algorithms as opposed to just memorizing certain formulas.
* Majority of the homeworks were very helpful in understanding concepts. In general, homeworks included both traditional math and theory based questions but also code implementation of certain algorithms. I'm glad there was a balance so I could see how the theory related to code in practice.
* I loved Shewchuk's lectures!

Cons:

* As someone who took neither EECS126/127 and survived off of the backs of EECS16B and CS70, I found HW2 very challenging and long. While I did learn many concepts, like multivariate Gaussians, I found some of the proofs unnecessary and too much work for someone who is inexperienced at math compared to my peers.
* HW difficulty and workload is generally inconsistent. Some homeworks are somewhat short, but other homeworks like 2 and 6 become very long.
* Grading bins are not transparent, but I've heard bins are generous.

Overall, I think it does a great job of introducing ML topics at a good level of depth. It is definitely a worthwhile course to take, and if you are interested in ML, if you can survive HW2, you should be fine in a Shewchuk semester.

CS 188 (Stuart Russell and Dawn Song)

Rating: 3/10

Workload: \~5-7 hr/week

Pros:

* Projects for the most part are really easy plug and chug. Definitely takes the stress off if you have a ton of other work to do.
* A small amount of content actually helped me understand some of a new research project I'm working on this summer.

Cons:

* Content at the end of the semester was very rushed, and in my opinion it is some of the most interesting.
* I have absolutely 0 clue why we decided to spend 2 whole weeks on a logic unit where we could have added at least taken one of the lectures and put it towards RL.
* No idea why grading policy claims participation is optional 5% extra credit, when the reality is that the bins are 5% shifted up from Fall 2021. The participation is only optional if you are a genius and absolutely crush the exams. To have a shot at even making a similar level bin as Fall 2021 you have to go to discussion or participate on Piazza. I don't have an issue with participation, but please don't claim it as extra credit when it is required for mere mortals like myself.
* The way the material is presented does not develop a sort of intuition you can get like from CS189, for example. I felt a lot of it became know X, Y, Z formulas (or I guess write it down on your cheat sheets).

Overall: If you are taking/have taken CS189, I don't think it is justifiable to take CS188 as a whole separate course when you could probably learn the relevant RL portions in 2 weeks tops (IMO if you are interested in RL, CS189->CS285 would probably be better). If you find Bayes Nets/HMMs fascinating, then take this course, but do it at the peril of wasting your time. It could perhaps be a good introductory course for those who don't want the hardcore nature of CS189 but still want some AI background.

EDIT: I don't want to rail on CS188. I think the course staff was helpful for project completion, discussion, etc. I just felt like the content actually taught in the class did not meet the high bar set by the other three classes mentioned here.","Damn ur crazy
it's funny that there's a whole unit on scheduling in 162 and course staff was absolute ass when it came to scheduling assignments this sem
U took four techsü§†
Cs 188 is a dogshit class. Keep railing :)
Fwiw we covered HMMs and PGMs in 189 too. So 188 is actually completely useless lmfao
Also will be saving this post!! :)
I love seeing people who want to get by the CS degree the easy, less stressful way by taking light techs like 160, 161, 186, 194s. Then they naively choose to take CS 188 and just get absolutely railed with the impossible difficult exams.
So you think 188 is harder than those?
188 is ""easy"" up until the exams. The content is so wishy-washy and everyone gets 100-ish on the projects and HW. 188 isn't a ""hard"" class, but 188 is a ""hard class to get a good grade in because wtf did we even learn"".
I took all of the classes OP mentioned and 188 ruined my 4.0 GPA (i got a B+)

It‚Äôs also his/her/their worst rated class. So yes, 188 was harder than all if those IMO. Your effort in this class doesn‚Äôt correlate well to the exams and the concepts don‚Äôt even come up as someone who‚Äôs interviewed for many ML engineer positions.
Seems like an odd way to run a course... so was it more useful to look at past exams?"

You could email before or talk to the staff (prof/gsi) at first lecture of both courses of being conflict and see if exams and finals can be resolved.

That really sucks to have 2 classes that is often combo‚Äôed to have the same time.  Anyhow, conflicts are allowed and lectures for both are recorded so there‚Äôs no issues there. 189 does not offer alternate exams.  161 will, immediately after the main Final, so you‚Äôre gonna have 2 consecutive back to back finals.  You need to check if there will be midterm conflicts.  Shewchuk‚Äôs schedule should be easy to figure out more or less, just use previous semesters‚Äô syllabus to figure out midterm dates. 

Word of advice - don‚Äôt use Schedule Planner, especially as a CS major, since the 999 discussion dummy often gives you weird options and you often wind up wading thru a bunch of bad options.  Easier to just lay things out using Excel IMO."
A screenshot of quotes (possibly some of his favorites?) Professor Shewchuk features on his UC faculty website. All seem curiously relevant / pertinent to his current situation. Thoughts?,https://i.redd.it/q2pnje4l3mpc1.png,2024-03-20 21:07:44,,"I'm chucking at how apt they are to the current situation
The website is here: [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~jrs/](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/)

The quotes are in the last text block, near the bottom, just above the photo of him on horseback.
look at the archive, 2012, it gets worse.
Link pls?
The only difference I can find is the Dirk Benedict quote ""the war against masculinity has been won"" which does make it worse, but by what you said I really was expecting some truly awful things. And considering that it's *missing* the transphobic hate speech, I think that the 2012 archive is an improvement over his website from 2 weeks ago. He removed that part right after the recent controversy.
https://archive.is/pesd
Yeah. The quote is p bad in context of where it was taken from tho
It's a scary incel message. Incels are a hate group, and they don't only target women. If Spewchuk were a high school student he'd be under observation right now. The gun fetish, the hostility toward those who don't look/act exactly like him, the sense of entitlement. This guy's unbalanced and UCB is gonna find that out the hard way.
I'm not defending him whatsoever, but upon first observation he strikes me as a fedora-wearing aspie redditor type. Everything so far kinda confirms that.
Oh, trust me, I know. I'm just saying that vague incel quotes are a slight improvement over straight up transphobic hate speech.
I don't know how that can be construed as a defence. Unless you're saying he's harmless. You don't know that and neither do I. All I know is that he has a gun fetish, he's hostile to trans people, he's anti-vax, and he talks about women ""within artillery range."" If you gave me a hundred people and asked me to predict which one will cause violence, he'd definitely make the top ten.
And statistically youd be wrong"
