thoughts 8 units over the summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nk770f/thoughts_8_units_over_the_summer/,2021-05-24 13:14:46,"Sorry, I know these posts come up on this subreddit often but I wanted to get some more opinions. I'm planning on taking PS1 w/ Thomas Kent (Session D) and Hist7B w/ Sandra Smith (Session C) this summer. Both are 4 units and basically during the same session. These classes also both have around a B+ average on Berkeleytime, although I don't know much about these two professors. 

I know its doable, but I was kind of looking forward to a more chill summer where I can still go out and enjoy summer break. I don't want to be super stressed trying to get A's like I was during fall and spring sem. Anyone have any idea what the workload will be like? Both these classes fulfill really useful requirements for my major and will get me ahead, but I don't mind subbing one for an easy 2 unit class (I need at least 6 units for fin aid) although I'd really like to take these 2 if I can. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!","Idk abt PS1 but Ik History 7B is hella easy and totally doable to get an A. It’s asynchronous so you don’t even have to attend lectures and the work in the class is minimal compared to other social science classes
I took history 7b this spring semester and the work was pretty chill. Also a pretty solid and relatively easy class to get an A
Took ps1 this spring and it was ok (ended with an A-). The midterm was pretty easy but the rubric for the essays were kinda vague imo. He’s lecturing is kinda dull and I enjoyed it more when it was Van Houweling lecturing, but it’s still a pretty good class. Decent amount of reading. No class or test curves tho
I took PS 1 with Kent last summer and it wasn’t too bad. There’s a midterm, final, final paper, group project, and weekly quizzes, so it’ll definitely keep you busy, but grading’s pretty good and lectures are completely asynchronous, so it’s manageable overall
OP, since these are lower, transferable courses, I highly recommend just taking them at a community college and saving money. You don’t have to submit any extra forms to Cal; just enroll in the ccc system
hi I know it's been a while since ur original post LMAOOO but did you ever end up taking hist7b w/ smith? if so how was it?
awesome thanks sm!!
sorry ik it's been long while since but who did you take hist7b with?
this is actually great advice! im still able to cancel these two classes and get a full refund right? im going to look into this more, don't know why i didn't think of this
LOL yes i did, it was super chill workload def wasnt too bad at all and all the assignments were related to lecture/reading so no curveballs. honestly i really enjoyed it!
i think you should be! check with the financial aid office"
Anyone taking pol sci 1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/arfigv/anyone_taking_pol_sci_1/,2019-02-16 17:22:20,"Is there anyone taking pol sci 1 with Thomas Kent this spring? How are you guys studying and preparing for upcoming midterm?
Should we do all readings?","In general, just do the readings.
Should I focus on reading textbook "
Polsci 1 Vs Polsci2,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/anoqe2/polsci_1_vs_polsci2/,2019-02-06 00:28:33,"Which one should I take?(Considering workload and difficulty of the test)
Polsci 1 with Thomas Kent vs Polsci 2 with Michael Fish

 it seems that grade distribution for pol sci 2 is better than pol sci 1 and for ur information,
I’ve studied US history before but not ap us government..

Thanks in advance!

","I took both (PS major) and I really enjoyed PS2 with Fish. Lecture is actually really enjoyable and the time goes by pretty fast (plus he gives exam questions in advance). PS1 is a pretty basic review of US politics so it’s not hard, but can get pretty dull.
PS2 with Fish is good but also intensive reading.  There are quizzes every week, but also has movie nights for extra credit.  Questions for midterma and finals are given out around a week in advance.  Seems only offered in Spring.  PS1 is offered every semester and summer as well.  
I took PS 1 with Pierson so this could be bad info. We didn't use a textbook, just readings on bcourses. The work was not too bad, if I studied for a midterm starting a few days in advance after showing up to lecture/discussion regularly, I got an A. My GSI (Sam Tractman) was fucking fantastic, was really helpful on essays and made that part of the class a breeze. Overall not too difficult.

I haven't, nor am I planning on taking PS 2, so I can't really comment on that, but this was my experience with PS1.
sam was a pretty bad gsi lmao 
Aw man I kinda liked him"
