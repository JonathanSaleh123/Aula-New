"Course Reviews Fall 2021 (CS 70, DATA 100, PHYSICS 7B, ETHSTD 175)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ronadp/course_reviews_fall_2021_cs_70_data_100_physics/,2021-12-25 18:34:25,"Hopefully this is helpful for anyone planning to take these classes in the future.

CS 70 (Satish Rao, Babak Ayazifar) [Rating: 6/10]
- Not my favorite course, but honestly nothing terrible about it either
- The content you learn is relatively useful
- Notes are very dense and hard to digest, but if you understand them you will do well
- Rao was okay at lecturing, active on Piazza, down to earth
- Ayazifar was a good lecturer, seemed passionate about teaching and made it interesting
- Homeworks were very long, ruined almost all of my Fridays/Saturdays
- You will do well if you put enough time into the class, but the amount of time it takes might not be worth it to some people
- How to do well: do past exams, be up-to-date on lectures, go to discussions to put concepts into practice
- Workload: 10-20 hours/week

DATA 100 (Fernando Perez, Alvin Wan) [Rating: 2/10]
- I really wanted to like this course: it went from being my favorite class this semester to being the worst class I have ever taken
- The content you learn is very practical and useful
- The lack of effort put into refreshing the recycled lectures was disheartening, but the lectures were otherwise good and not hard to follow
- Labs were well-written and generally useful
- Homeworks were still useful but not as well-written
- Discussions felt like a waste of time to me, basically a rehash of lecture but worse and the worksheets did not teach me much
- The midterm was @#$% and not at all representative of how well you learned the material
- The final project experience really depends on your group, I personally had to work way harder because of some group members who contributed nearly nothing
- How to do well: the reason the class sucked this semester is because you could understand the material perfectly well, work hard, and still get a bad grade. I personally ended up with a good grade, but sunk so much time into the final project that I didn't have time to study for my other classes. My recommendation is to take this course with a professor that probably cares more (e.g. Hug in Spring 2022)
- Workload: 8 hours/week normally, 25 hours/week during final project

PHYSICS 7B (Robert Birgeneau) [Rating: 2/10]
- Another one of my least favorite courses
- You don't learn much relevant material in this course (at least for computer science)
- Birgeneau seemed like a nice, well-intentioned professor, but unfortunately the lectures were almost useless in preparing you for exams
- Out of the 180-200 people enrolled in the class, only about 10 showed up to lecture near the end of the semester
- They sent out a survey for feedback on lectures since attendance was low, but there were only about 2 weeks of classes left, so this was quite insulting
- Discussions were also relatively useless if you didn't already understand the material—most people I knew only showed up to get the bonus points for attending >50% of discussions
- Labs were the most engaging part of the class for me and taught useful concepts, but there were only 4 and they did not help me prepare for exams
- Homeworks could have been useful for preparing for exams, but I was more concerned about getting a good grade since getting anything wrong lost points
- Exams tested nothing conceptual—the best way I can put it is that they were a test of how well you could memorize formulas and perform calculus calculations
- How to do well: the class was as close to a textbook as you could get. Read the textbook thoroughly, especially when it shows derivations. Do the example problems in each section because these will often show up on the exams
- Workload: 8-12 hours/week (depends on how long you spend on the textbook, whether there is an upcoming lab or exam)

ETHSTD 175 (Greg Choy) [Rating: 9/10]
- I liked this class a lot, it was refreshing compared to the rest of my classes this semester
- You learn about a lot of history and literature that you probably know/have heard/wouldn't be surprised about, but that you probably haven't discussed before
- Choy was a great lecturer, and super reasonable in his approach to teaching
- There are no assignments besides reading (which is quite heavy, but you could honestly get away with some light skimming)
- The ""midterms"" were super chill, could usually work in groups and were basically short essays that you had a week to work on
- The great thing about this class is that it's more concerned with you learning something than with scoring you—I learned even while writing and discussing the exam questions with my group and you can't really say that for many other classes
- There was an end-of-semester poetry presentation where you/your group gets to be the lecturer for ~30 min
- How to do well: just attend and pay attention in all lectures, take notes, do the readings and you will definitely do well. That being said, you get out of the class as much as you put in, so you may also want to participate by asking questions, discussing during class, etc.
- Workload: 6-12 hours/week (depends on what readings are assigned and how thoroughly you read them)","Yo its Christmas. Take a load off from thinking about school work and spend time with friends and family if you can. You deserve it!
how was the data 100 midterm different from expectations? was it drastically different from past midterms? what was the avg
Should I push CS 70 back to my junior fall? I’m planning on taking it this summer so I can declare before junior fall
The midterm was half on ML when the class spent maybe 1-2 lectures and 1/3 of a lab on it.
Average was 38/85. High was also 71/85. Also consider most of these kids have cs experience. Most bs midterm I've ever taken."
