"Randy Howard Katz, the United Microelectronics Corporation Distinguished Professor in EECS, was appointed Cal's vice chancellor for research. A 1980 Cal Ph.D. graduate who joined the faculty in 1983, he helped develop many of the wireless tools and fast, reliable computer storage we take for granted",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/12/06/computer-scientist-randy-katz-named-vice-chancellor-for-research/,2017-12-06 21:49:55,,"So he's the one to blame for AirBears2
thanks randy
So we're replacing Randy Graham with Randy Howard?  Seems like a good idea.
If I'm not mistaken AirBears2 was done by student computing staff or something like that."
"As Computer Coding Classes Swell, So Does Cheating. ""There's a lot of discussion about it, both inside a department as well as across the field,"" said Randy H. Katz, a Cal EECS professor, who found in a year 100 of his 700 students in a class violated course policy on collaborating or copying code.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/us/computer-science-cheating.html,2017-05-30 08:55:06,,"Randy's a great guy. Various kinds of cheating is definitely widespread in lowerdiv CS classes unfortunately. 

I was talking to Armando Fox who teaches 169 when he said that what he genuinely wanted was to do take-home tests rather than midterms, to more accurately emulate the real world aspects of having time and being able to look around the web for solutions. The only thing stopping him was he knew that a very substantial proportion of students would cheat which also ruins it for the ones who don't.
Wow a lot of people in the ""real world"" do copying.

> Many students would argue that professional programmers copy code all the time, and they're not wrong about that. In addition, looking at other programmers' code and how they solved a problem are effective ways to learn. I took a somewhat different approach to this issue in my teaching. Rather than prohibiting copying, I lectured extensively on how to document code, cite its source, and explain the sometimes subtle differences that one made to adapt it to the problem at hand. When my teaching assistants and I caught students copying without citing, which of course some did, we penalized them in various ways as described in this article and in others' comments. But when they cited their sources and documented their work correctly and explained the code (using inline comments), there was no penalty. Tying citing references in code to citing references in their papers for other classes also helped to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences, which I always felt was a worthwhile goal.

> I totally understand the need to try to get students to solve problems on their own. But, as a programmer of 30 years I can say that learning to legally copy code from examples on the web is the single most important skill a programmer can learn today. For many years I had to constantly reinvent the wheel, which was a huge waste of time. Today, the internet provides a rich source of code examples that can legally (repeat, legally) be reused by anyone. Does my employer or clients care if I invented the code I write as long as it works and is delivered on time? No.
>
> Does this mean I don't need to know how to write my own code? Of course not. 99% of the my code is original, but that 1% I get from others can be critical to solving a particular problem. Schools should allow and even encourage some use of public domain code as long as there is attribution, the same as including quoted sources in a text paper.

> Waste of time and effort to stop this ""cheating"". Coders in the real world copy each other all the time, and should. Each coder has to ensure that the copied code actually works in his/her program; this exercise is almost as hard as inventing the code. I encourage copying others' code (unless it's proprietary of course). Coding is NOT like writing. Coding is rigorously correct logic with no room for nuance.

Jim Dickinson, Columbus, Ohio

> I received my computer science degree from Ohio State University 16 years ago and cheating on coding projects was fairly common even then. Good paying jobs in software were growing swiftly at that time and lots of people wanted in on that whether they were able to learn to code or not. 
> 
> In group projects other people would often provide code sections that made no sense and did not work as intended. Often their code could not even be compiled into actual software. When I would ask them to explain what they were trying to do they couldn't answer even the most basic questions about the concepts. There was a lot of pressure to turn in good labs on time, so those of us who were good coders wrote most of the code and the others were more or less just along for the ride. On individual projects they simply turned in code that they had gotten from friends and hoped for the best. I had one friend who knew virtually nothing about how to write software and received his bachelor's degree in computer science the same day that I did. He then pursued an MBA and subsequently went on to a very successful career at a major software company.

> For people whom coding is not easy and who know that they are being graded on their coding, cheating may be the best they can do. As I recall my physics and calculus classes, both were run by professors who did not understand how any student could have a hard time with the material. The textbooks were not written with the non-intuitive student in mind. If we had classes where professors stepped us through the material and explained it to us many of us would have done much better. Even when I went for help during office hours some of my professors told me that it was my fault for not working hard enough rather than helping me. 
> 
> In four years of college I had two professors who truly helped me when I asked for it. One spent over an hour with me explaining and modeling a difficult concept in organic chemistry until both he and I were satisfied that I understood it. Understanding is the key word here. If a student has other work to complete and cannot understand the assignment or the concepts in one course, and the professor or TA isn't able to assist, cheating is going to occur. Coding is not easy. Sometimes the only way to understand something is to copy it and watch it work. Smart professors would run the classes in such a way as to encourage questions and explanations as to why one way will work and another not. In fact, that's how every class needs to be taught.

Steven Raaen, New York

> I just finished a six month programming course at Rutgers. Instructors were adamant that the best way to learn to code is to review and share each others' work. It is the modern culture of coding. Before spending hours trying to find the flaw in our work, we are encouraged to have a classmate look it over. More often than not the issue is frustratingly simple like using a comma instead of a period. Coding is like that. A colleague or classmate will often spot a trivial error in seconds, freeing us from hours of tail-chasing. 
> 
> This is the world that graduates are entering. While my course was ""non-credit"", perhaps high-end university programs could benefit by encouraging more collaboration among students.
If you don't borrow from stackoverflow, you're lying.  Whether you're still in school or working in industry.

Doable schedule for CS in Spring?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3n4k7n/doable_schedule_for_cs_in_spring/,2015-10-01 10:33:46,"Is taking
CS61C (Randy H. Katz; Vladimir Stojanovic)
CS160 (Bj√∂rn Hartmann)
CS170 (Alessandro Chiesa; Umesh Vazirani)
in Spring a reasonable workload? Or would replacing 160 with 188 (Peter Abbeel) be a better combination? Thanks in advance.","Seems doable. I think 188 and 170 have better synergy though, plus 160 and 61c are both project-based classes.
170 is not a difficult class. 
ehh

CS61C - boring and annoying

CS160 - I've beard bad things about the project-centered format

CS170 - boring and annoying

CS188 - boring and annoying
yeah I might switch out 160 for 188, thanks!
I think you mean

61C - oohh glorious eecs

CS160 - make dank eecs designs

CS170 - eecs theory so gr8

CS188 - dank pacman memes
That's entirely dependant on your personal preferences. For example, 61C is super interesting if you have any interest in how computers actually work. "
"Is this suicide? CS70, 61B and 61C in one semester",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3ju6yz/is_this_suicide_cs70_61b_and_61c_in_one_semester/,2015-09-06 01:26:50,"I'm a junior transfer in eecs, and I have a decent amount of programming knowledge. So far I have been flying through 61A, but I'm sure it will get more challenging. I had taken java at my community college but I considered it a joke (the class not java). Anyhow, to be able to intern and take upper div next year, I need to finish my lower div as soon as possible.  

I know for sure I will be taking 61B and CS70 since that's the pre req for every upper div. However, I'm stuck on what my third class should be.. my choices are either 16b(I'm in 16a right now, that's the new ee20/40), 61C, or a upper div humanity.

here is a good layout:
My current schedule is ee16a, 61a, psych167AC
Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), CS61C(Randy H. Katz; Vladimir Stojanovic)

OR: Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), ee16b(Michel Maharbiz)

the 61b teacher looks good, cs70 is going to suck either way, but which is the better teacher between 16b and 61c?

","Its ok to take 61b/61c/70 together because they don't overlap that much, but you might have multiple projects due on the same week... which will be hell week for you. I took 61B with Hug, and he is one of the best professors I had at Berkeley. Sahai for 70 will be tough, but you'll learn a lot
I've heard some pretty bad things about Maharbiz for EE20/EE40, so I assume it'd be similar for EE16B. I don't think that schedule will be easy but if you have a good amount of programming knowledge and experience then it's possible. I've known some junior transfers that have taken similarly rigorous courseloads and done well.
I did something similar. I spent basically 7-10 hours in the library every weekday working on homework/projects. If you're okay with that, go for it.
A friend of mine did 61B, 61C, and 70 all in one semester, with no other classes (except a small decal). It's doable but you'll probably have to spend a LOT of time working on projects. What she did was aim to finish all projects the week before they're due so that she has buffer room to deal with other things. 
I took EE40 with Maharbiz last semester, and honestly the memes and whatnot are incredibly exaggerated imo. It's a pretty straightforward class, and in terms of work you'll be fine as long as you start on stuff as soon as it's assigned. It's a prelab that takes 2 or so hours a week and hw that takes maybe 4-5 hours."
Update on planning for the fall semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gettt4/update_on_planning_for_the_fall_semester/,2020-05-06 15:12:53,"Just sent to students, faculty, and staff:

\##

Dear faculty, staff and students,

We are writing today to provide an update on our ongoing planning for fall semester operations. The planning process is wide-ranging and is deepening every day as we bring more faculty and staff onto the committees (described below) that are helping us envision what the fall term could look like. We aim to make key decisions in regard to fall operations by mid-June.

**Guiding Principle**

A single principle guides all of this work: **to protect the** **health of our community**. There are additional sets of principles that guide our plans for instruction and research. We are committed to upholding Berkeley‚Äôs excellence across all of our mission areas.

**Scenario Planning**

Because we don‚Äôt know what the spread of COVID-19 will look like over the course of the next few months, each committee below has been asked to develop plans for each of the following three scenarios for the fall semester:

* **Scenario #1:** For public health reasons, the campus must continue with **full remote** instruction, and predominantly remote work being done in the operations and research realms.
* **Scenario #2**: **In-person** operations resume, **with limits** and restrictions imposed by public health authorities.
* **Scenario #3**: Campus operations largely **return** **to normal** (i.e., mostly in-person), but wherever possible, will accommodate students, staff, researchers and instructors who need or prefer to operate remotely due to continuing pandemic conditions.

**Committees**

Each of the following committees has been charged with studying and making suggestions for a key area of campus operations. Each committee will be led by members of the¬†[Chancellor‚Äôs Cabinet](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/about-office/chancellors-cabinet) and special advisors who will share their committees‚Äô progress and recommendations during weekly Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet will use the recommendations to guide decision-making as we develop plans to resume operations in a way that maximizes community safety.¬† In addition, we will look for opportunities to incorporate the broad range of student perspectives.¬†

The current committees are:

1. **COVID-19 Public Health and Testing Advisory** **Committee.** Led by Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics in the School of Public Health.
2. **Research**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Research Randy Katz.
3. **Instruction**. Led by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Paul Alivisatos.
4. **Student Engagement and Services**. Co-led by Vice Provost for Graduate Studies Lisa Garcia Bedolla, Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion Oscar Dub√≥n, Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education Cathy Koshland, and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
5. **Housing and Dining**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
6. **Operations**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher. There are three subcommittees within the Operations working group: Workforce, led by Vice Provost for the Faculty Benjamin Hermalin and Chief People and Culture Officer Eugene Whitlock; Events and External Relations; and Information Technology, led by Jenn Stringer.
7. **Athletics**. Led by Director of Athletics James Knowlton.
8. **Financial Planning**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Finance Rosemarie Rae.
9. **Communications**. Led by Associate Vice Chancellor for Communications and Public Affairs Diana Harvey.

Again, all of this planning is being done with public health guidelines as our backdrop. We will proceed only with the guidance and express approval of local public health authorities.

We will continue to provide regular status reports about this critical planning process on the campus¬†[COVID-19 website](https://news.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/), under the Return to Campus tab. In addition, our next [Campus Conversations](https://campusconversations.berkeley.edu/) event on Monday, April 12 will feature Chancellor Christ, and we [invite you to submit questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaeOwW_QfTa7aTkwtcgeHcH181ohlmZy9lbgW-7n0BDEGrew/viewform) about the plans and structures we have established here. We‚Äôll make every effort to address your inquiries on Monday‚Äôs webcast.

Thank you for everything you are doing to support the university‚Äôs mission and serve our students. It is indeed a challenging and uncertain time, and we have been so grateful for your commitment, as well as your patience and flexibility. What makes Berkeley *Berkeley* is not just our physical campus, or our history, or our traditions‚Ä¶ above all else, it is our community. No matter what our fall semester looks like, we will remain strong because of the dedicated service of so many of you.","At some point, a definitive decision has to be made, regardless of the ambiguity of trusted pandemic projections. Although these committees are certainly doing well by preparing for these various scenarios, let‚Äôs not forget that this is the institution preparing ITSELF for the Fall. 

Students are still in the same situation, and completely unaware of what Fall will bring, and many are considering withdrawing, staying home, etc., and are facing a wide array of difficulties from both the unresponsiveness of the administration and the community function. 

Other academic institutions in CA have declared their Fall policy. Berkeley should too, considering it‚Äôs an international hub in the Bay Area, there can‚Äôt be any more people left in the dark about this.
‚ÄúIn addition, our next Campus Conversations event on Monday, April 12 will feature Chancellor Christ, and we invite you to submit questions about the plans and structures we have established here. We‚Äôll make every effort to address your inquiries on Monday‚Äôs webcast.‚Äù

Um did y‚Äôall forget to proof read? It‚Äôs already May lol

Are these people seriously considering a *normal* fall semester after March 10?
The goal is to have final decisions on the major elements by mid-June. Let me know which areas you're referring to re unresponsiveness? I can try to help. We're moving as quickly as we can given the magnitude of the decisions and the changing public health landscape and guidance.
Eep, evidently. It's this coming Monday (...the 11th) at noon. I honestly don't know how we got the month *and* day wrong. We're sending another short message out on Friday so at least it'll clarify things.
Not saying that it is more likely, but from what I have heard about ""hybrid,"" I think it is #2, where let's say big CS lectures are online but small studio classes and really necessary labs offer the in person option.
I think people are worried mostly about housing. It would be hard to find housing now, let alone mid June
can we please get a specific date? Some of us have potential leases in the air and would like to decide whether or not to sign them asap. Having a specific date allows us to negotiate with our landlords as there'll be a clear deadline for us to make our decision by.
Can you please clarify if an online option will be offered regardless of what happens? As a non traditional student at a much higher health risk this is gravely important to me. In one e-mail it was announced it would be guaranteed, whereas this e-mail doesn't seem to hold this promise (i.e, I can't imagine with scenario 3 professors would abide to an online format if it wasn't required and some people were going to class in person)
To emphasize housing concerns on a financial level: 

We are guaranteed an online option, and a question mark for in person. Given that many leases end in May and people need to renew *right now*, the financially secure option is to cancel your lease, because 

a) the semester is fully online, and you save on the rent + 
b) the semester is also in person, in which you would miss out on in-person classes (if you can't find last minute housing), but would still get to work towards your degree

But if you plan for in-person courses, you take on **significant** risks. You take on financial risk of an entire year of rent, and if you are unable to find roommates (of which many are too scared to commit to a full year of rent for the same reasons), or end up with roommates who would rather take the smaller financial hit of cancelling their part of the lease come Fall, then you're really in deep for it now. Coupled with the fact that college students are really, really bad at communicating negative risks until the last minute, and it's a sizable fear for a lot of people.

---

Edit: I don't know how the UC would be able to help with this by releasing any plans earlier. Many leases have 90 day move out clauses, meaning a lot of people have already made the decision to stay or go. I am curious to see if on-campus population for Fall 2020 has already met its fate and been locked in by this point in time.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier right now? I would have thought the lack of students would have made things alit cheaper.
This from the provost's office: All indications at this point are that there will be an online option for all or nearly all classes to accommodate those who cannot obtain visas as well as students and instructors who may be at elevated risk.
True
I think its mostly because of contracts and subleasing hassles? Pretty confusing times rn
Which scenario are you all leaning towards right now?
Thank you!!
Interesting. I would have thought demand was super low."
