Bio 1B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gq5r0/bio_1b/,2023-10-25 23:28:51,"Want to take Bio 1B but was wondering if anyone knew anything about these professors: John Huelsenbeck, Michal Shuldman? Also I know attendance wasn't mandatory this semester, wondering if it the same for next semester ? 

Also any good recommendations for easy R1B's?",
"rate my schedule, advice/insights",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/192wjen/rate_my_schedule_adviceinsights/,2024-01-09 17:58:04,"hi! i am a freshman (2027) pre-med taking these classes and would like to know if this schedule is feasible, if you have any advice for the courses, or if you have reviews on the professors. please let me know!

* CHEM 3A - Peter Marsden
* Theater 25AC - Angela Marino
* BIO 1B -  John P Huelsenbeck, Michal Ilana Shuldman, Benjamin Wong Blonder, Benjamin K Blackman
* R1A
* Decal","This is a reasonable schedule in my opinion! Marsden has optional HW (you would still want to do it because the HW mirrors the exam) but if you don't feel like doing it you'd always have the flexibility!

BIO 1B is not set up like a weeder class compared to BIO 1A, but it is still a difficult class because of the memorization. The labs are fully done in-lab, so there's no lab report or anything like that due after class.

I haven't taken the rest but this seems very reasonable
Marsden is the best professorv
OMG! THR 25AC is going to be an absolute blast! I had a different professor for that class, but I had Angela for THR 119 and she is the absolute best! She‚Äôs really understanding about mental health, time conflicts, etc and just wants to encourage discussion :) Of course THR 25AC tends to be a bit bigger than the upper divs, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be the same in terms of vibes :) Hope you have a great time with her!
hi! no advice but i wanted to say im also taking similar classes w bio 1b:) also pre med! we got this fr
Marsden is amazing! Have fun
The only note is that I believe the BIO 1B and CHEM 3A finals are usually back to back on the same day, but if you‚Äôre alright with that, then it looks good!
thank you so much!
what were your thoughts with THTR 119?
yes yes!!!
My class experience was a bit interesting for THR 119. Because of the events in October, our class discussions turned away from actual reading material. A lot of my friends in the class disliked it, but I previously felt like she made a safe space in the class and it was very nice to be able to talk about whatever. The only bad thing is she randomly drops assignments on you. Our final felt like it came out of nowhere. However, I had a lot of fun in the class :)"
Bio 1B Practice Material + Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pctnkc/bio_1b_practice_material_advice/,2021-08-27 11:57:36,"Hey, I'm taking Bio 1B with Professor John Huelsenbeck and was wondering if anyone was ever able to find practice exams or past exams? I'm unable to find any and was hoping to get some advice about how to study for his exams and what to expect.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! :)","huelsenbeck will be as easy as it gets in that class. theyre straightforward multiple choice, fact based.
As the other comment said huelsenbeck‚Äôs exams are easier compared to ecology and organismal biology exams. Best ways to study would be the basic stuff which is take notes, review the PDFs and practice questions he gives and most importantly make sure you watch all his lectures and you‚Äôll be good"
Choosing between Physics and Bio,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hbvvfb/choosing_between_physics_and_bio/,2020-06-18 23:50:20,"Hey, if you had to choose between taking Org Chem 3B alongside Physics 8a or Bio 1b, which would you pick? Bio 1b being with John P. Huelsenbeck and Bruce G Baldwin and Physics 8a with unknown.

Also, are either of those classes likely to fill up with freshmen or anything before we can Phase 2? Bio has 200ish seats open now, Physics has 100ish.

Go bears (and tigers obvs)","I‚Äôd go Physics for three reasons. 
1. 3BL and 1B both are 4 hour labs. I took 10 hours of lab my freshman year ‚Äî that shit HURTED. Physics ‚Äúlab‚Äù is like 2 hours and only 5-7 labs, the other labs are just discussion sections during lab time. 
2. Physics is a series ‚Äî assuming you‚Äôre IB/MCB or some other bio you‚Äôll likely have to take 8B. If you don‚Äôt take 8A fall, you‚Äôll push back the series to 8A spring 8B fall. Rather than bio 1B spring with physics 8b and being done w lowerdivs by spring.
3. Idk if you‚Äôre premed but Physics is pretty heavily tested in one of the sections, especially basic 8A and some 8B concepts. Bio 1B on the other hand? Completely nonexistent. Delay bio if you need to take the MCAT."
Spring schedule advice (pls help üòî ),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jhknfk/spring_schedule_advice_pls_help/,2020-10-24 18:09:25,"I'm a freshman and kind lost on what classes to take. Rn I'm taking; math 1b, r1a, and anthro3ac. I'm also intended mcb. what would you think about this schedule?

Next semester I'm thinking about

1. chem 1a/1al with alexis shusterman
2. bio 1b with  David D. Ackerly, Bruce G Baldwin, John P. Huelsenbeck, Joshua D Povich
   1. would this class fill up fast???
3. not sure any good recs? I'm thinking of minoring in human rights so maybe a class for that?
4. lastly, i do want to try to take some sort of public health seminar and see if that's something i am interested in ... would also love any recs if u have any :)

&#x200B;

Thank you so much for your help. I'm a first gen student and jesus the help i get from this reddit, I'm so thankful for <3","Someone replied to my post which pretty much asked the same thing for chem 1A/1AL with Shusterman.
