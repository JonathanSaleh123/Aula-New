Choosing between Physics and Bio,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hbvvfb/choosing_between_physics_and_bio/,2020-06-18 23:50:20,"Hey, if you had to choose between taking Org Chem 3B alongside Physics 8a or Bio 1b, which would you pick? Bio 1b being with John P. Huelsenbeck and Bruce G Baldwin and Physics 8a with unknown.

Also, are either of those classes likely to fill up with freshmen or anything before we can Phase 2? Bio has 200ish seats open now, Physics has 100ish.

Go bears (and tigers obvs)","I‚Äôd go Physics for three reasons. 
1. 3BL and 1B both are 4 hour labs. I took 10 hours of lab my freshman year ‚Äî that shit HURTED. Physics ‚Äúlab‚Äù is like 2 hours and only 5-7 labs, the other labs are just discussion sections during lab time. 
2. Physics is a series ‚Äî assuming you‚Äôre IB/MCB or some other bio you‚Äôll likely have to take 8B. If you don‚Äôt take 8A fall, you‚Äôll push back the series to 8A spring 8B fall. Rather than bio 1B spring with physics 8b and being done w lowerdivs by spring.
3. Idk if you‚Äôre premed but Physics is pretty heavily tested in one of the sections, especially basic 8A and some 8B concepts. Bio 1B on the other hand? Completely nonexistent. Delay bio if you need to take the MCAT."
Spring schedule advice (pls help üòî ),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jhknfk/spring_schedule_advice_pls_help/,2020-10-24 18:09:25,"I'm a freshman and kind lost on what classes to take. Rn I'm taking; math 1b, r1a, and anthro3ac. I'm also intended mcb. what would you think about this schedule?

Next semester I'm thinking about

1. chem 1a/1al with alexis shusterman
2. bio 1b with  David D. Ackerly, Bruce G Baldwin, John P. Huelsenbeck, Joshua D Povich
   1. would this class fill up fast???
3. not sure any good recs? I'm thinking of minoring in human rights so maybe a class for that?
4. lastly, i do want to try to take some sort of public health seminar and see if that's something i am interested in ... would also love any recs if u have any :)

&#x200B;

Thank you so much for your help. I'm a first gen student and jesus the help i get from this reddit, I'm so thankful for <3","Someone replied to my post which pretty much asked the same thing for chem 1A/1AL with Shusterman.
