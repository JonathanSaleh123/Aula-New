I'm thinking of taking eps 20 earthquakes with noha farghal. is this a good idea?","Yeah, EPS 20 is super easy and light. 3 homeworks, final exam, and group project. Just make sure to get the formulas down for HW because 1 point lost is like 1 percent of your final grade lost.

Yeah I took this last summer.
Thanks!!"
