peter hurtubise,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/194ikvh/peter_hurtubise/,2024-01-11 17:26:06,"i'm taking him this semester, is he an alright professor? I don't see any reviews on rate my prof so I'm just wondering. Thank you.","I had him in Fall 2022 for Sociology of Education and he was chill af. Passionate speeches at the end of every class.
He is the absolute best! His class work is manageable and he genuinely cares for his students. He used to have a really good score on rate my professors I‚Äôm unsure why it‚Äôs gone
He's a prof now? Good for him! He used to be my liaison at the Alumni House,  and he was such a sweet person. A real gem to work with. Sorry, I don't know him as an instructor,  but he is a good dude.
I am taking the same class for Spring 2024, I'm glad that the comments like yours are talking about how nice he is!
Oh thank you! Have you taken his Sociology 180E class? It's in English right? Im wondering bc im mainly taking it for the international studies breath requirement. (I just added this course last minute bc I just found out my other class was in a language I had no knowledge in..)
I took a different class with him but I have taken soc 180 and it was in English :)
Thank you again üôè. If you don't mind, how are his exams formatted?
If I remember correctly, they were take home free response questions and he gave you lots of time to complete them
Oh thank you. Sorry for the many questions, but what does home free response mean?
No worries! Free response means he‚Äôll post a few questions about information you‚Äôve learned during lecture and you have to answer them, you can use your notes. They‚Äôre shorter than an essay in length. And this isn‚Äôt something you do in class, you can work on it at home and turn it in through bcourses
Okay great! Thank you for answering my questions ü´∂ü´∂ good luck this semester"
SOCIOL 113AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dlec8v/sociol_113ac/,2024-06-21 13:51:45,Does anybody have any information on this class with professor Peter Hurtubise? ,"Highly recommend, work was pretty light for me and professor was very inspiring"
Help with spring classesüò≠,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y9gbt5/help_with_spring_classes/,2022-10-20 18:42:38,"I am a transfer senior majoring in sociology, I am looking for any easy classes in or outside of my major so I can enjoy my last semester help please!","Nst 10 was pretty easy. You literally just control F for the midterms

ib35ac, since you are socio major, you might be interested in looking at social issues and identities from a biology/science lens. basically it uses biology to tell you how race, ethnicity, gender etc can be diverse and that is beautiful/nature. i really really enjoyed the reading and this class in general. it was also a very easy a class.  however the prof has changed so i am not sure about this part.
Thanks for the recommendation! Did you also enjoy the class?

Did you take it with Peter Hurtubise?
Yes it was interesting material and info that you can apply to your own life as well.
Try Nusctx 10S Intro to human nutrition: managing life by Aponte. I took it last spring, unsure if it‚Äôs offered in the fall too."

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"
