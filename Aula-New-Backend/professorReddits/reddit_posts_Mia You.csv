Can you please post article titles along, or instead of, the out-of-context quotes that you usually provide?
She's such an inspiration. For all you privileged and spoiled rich students on here who had mommy and daddy pay for everything while you were in high school and even now that you're at Cal, try actually having to work and raise a kid AND be a female minority from a disadvantaged background AND make it to a good school like Cal.

You wouldn't have been able to, I guarantee it. The fact is that most of you came from a privileged background and had everything handed to you. Most of you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth. Your mommy and daddy bought you a car, paid the insurance and gas, paid for your new iphones and covered the monthly bill, took you on lavish European vacations, made sure you were fed and had clean clothes and a lunch to take to school every day, bought you everything you wanted, gave you your own room, etc. Students like Mia, on the other hand, have to work 10 times harder for what they have. Most of you don't know what it's like to struggle. So before you come on here talking your crap as usual, check your privilege first.

Oh, and in case you're wondering why I made a new account, I was shadow banned.
why can't we just congratulate her for her accomplishments?

you are right that some people do have more privilege here than others, but shitting on them and their life rn isn't exactly conducive to solving the issue. 

If I really wanted to, i could say you have internet access and a right to free speech. check your privilege! 
Or you could just wear a condom while having sex?
Unless she was raped or her birth control failed she made a choice to become a parent.  She wasn't born with a son.
Whoa, bucko. Let's not get crazy now. I check my privilege DAILY. 
must be a stressful life. try doing something about policy instead of being so holier than thou on the berkeley reddit lmao.
well I'm always fighting for Trans rights, so speak for yourself mister. what have you done for trans rights???

i'll wait...
lmao u just assumed my gender. ah the irony. 
That's what I thought. You haven't done a single thing.
1. I don't owe you any explanation. I'm content with the things I've done to further the causes I believe in. 

2. I hope you keep belittling those that might actually agree with your beliefs. that's how we're gonna move forward...(ps thats sarcasm) 
Be honest, you're one of those spoiled rich kids I was talking about. Reading my original post set you off because it described you to the T. Check your privilege and have a good day.
hokay troll. 

I've never said that I don't have privilege. Of course, there are areas where I do have privilege (financial stability, cisgender, etc.) and areas where I don't (being a woman, person of color, etc.). 

However, your tone and dialogue above is not a smart way of having a discourse about the issue at hand. Learn to be an adult and have an intelligent conversation instead of one-upping me on reddit.

Why are you posting everything from daily cal and the cal website? It's kind of spamming dude. 
Is there any relevance to her being a SoCal native?
Take a look at his profile and scroll as far back as you possibly can

""Water-drinker"" Mia talks about how it felt to go bunjeee jumping.
You are mentally unstable. You call yourself an anarchist but call people fobs, bitches, freaks, tell them to go learn to speak English and go kill themselves? Wow, that's evil. 

Get some help, and in the meantime keep your bigoted garbage off the internet. And change your username, you're not a real anarchist. "

Advice on Spring 2021 Course Schedule + Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jg65ml/advice_on_spring_2021_course_schedule_professors/,2020-10-22 12:05:17,"I‚Äôm a freshman and am trying to transfer to COE for either MechE or CivE. I looked on rate my prof and there were some professors that had ratings and some that didn‚Äôt show up. Some of the ratings were for other classes the professor taught so I‚Äôm not sure if it all applies. If you have any advice on this schedule or the professors teaching these courses or the courses in general please let me know.

Spring 2021

-Chem 1A (Alexis Shusterman)

-Chem 1AL (Michelle Douskey)

-Math 53 (Zvezdelina Stankova)

-Engin 26 (Kourosh Youssefi)

-some r#b course
  
  - French R1B (Trevor Sanders)
 
  - Italian R5B (Mia Fuller) 
 
  - Asian American Studies R2B (David Pham)
 
  - Environmental Design R3B 

TLDR: pls give experience with any of these profs/classes","I'm taking math 53 and chem 1a/1al right now. As far as I can say, chem 1a/1al is a bunch of busy work, that might not all be fun or engaging or interesting or even intellectually stimulating at times, but it really requires you to be on your feet at all times. To be successful in that class, you gotta just either know the material beforehand or just watch a bunch of youtube videos on the topics, either from khan and organic chem tutor. Nothing from lectures has helped me anyway. As for math, it's been ok. As long as you read the book and do the hw, you should be ok.
I took E26 with Youseffi and it's a somewhat low workload class, especially if you already have experience with CAD. If you don't have experience, then the labs may take you a bit longer to complete. I didn't have CAD experience and I found the labs somewhat ok after asking for help from my GSI and friends. There aren't any midterms/tests but the final was tough. People who do have CAD experience find the class fairly easy so it depends on your background. I recommend going to lab sections if you need help.
Ok, thank you!
Ok, thank you!"
Weekly poll idea,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3twdjr/weekly_poll_idea/,2015-11-22 19:59:02,"I think it'd be cool to have a weekly anonymous poll to get an idea of what's going on in each others' lives. I'm sure lots of us are curious about the demographics of /r/berkeley, but more than that I think a lot of students feel lonely, have imposter syndrome, and would otherwise benefit from knowing their situation isn't unique. Possible polls:

* Stress/happiness level
* Major
* Age
* How much you actually study/how easy school is for you
* Cannabis and alcohol use
* Hobbies
* Dream jobs
* Whether you secretly think Stanfurd is better and are just butthurt you didn't get in
* Opinion of /r/berkeley users/the student body
* Favorite book/TV show
* Are you depressed, hopeless, anxious, and oh god what's the point anymore, do I even want to care, is it my fault or is Cal just unfair, maybe if I ignore this problem set it'll disappear and I'll be a kid again

The mods have been MIA lately, so I'd like to get your opinion on this. You also must have more interesting ideas than mine for poll topics.","I like this idea. How will poll topics be generated?
I'm super down for this. This is a great idea, but make sure you can actually accept all the responses you get :P
Anyone could suggest topics in each week's thread, and we'd just go down the list.

&#x200B;

First off, I'm very grateful for what I have and know that other people have it worse (e.g. Fall 2019 transfers who are graduating with one in-person semester). My experience here at Berk thus far has been more than what I could've imagined (in the best way possible) and I'm excited for the next step. Nonetheless, I'm stupid stressed right now with everything at the moment. **This is a random recollection of thoughts I've had, so I'm sorry if this is hard to follow.** I wanted to vent this out before heading back to binge Persona 5 Royal which is so good!

&#x200B;

\*\* Things are real again with vaccine eligibility opening up. From needing to find an apartment, hoping to secure a research position next year, and learning how to code, there's a lot that I have on my plate as a transfer. I'm welcome to change but I'm still in disbelief that I'll be leaving the home I've known for two decades next fall. **Nothing has felt real with the pandemic and it probably won't until I live in Berkeley and gradually adjust to everything.**

&#x200B;

\*\*  I suppose part of this is stressful because I started my extracurriculars late as the near-sighted kid I was a few years ago. I'm already effectively taking a gap year in graduating a year later and while another would be welcome (for pressure relief), I'm not really sure how I feel about that. I don't compare myself to others anymore and haven't done so in a long time but eh... graduate school is a stressful motherfucker.

&#x200B;

\*\* I can't really tell if I have imposter syndrome or not if its simply my current situation. My community college was the shit and I worked my ass off from being a shitty student in high school (i.e. it was a rough patch in my life then). The professors there were also great and focused solely on the teaching experience. With a gap year and heading back to finish up graduate school requirements, I've been left a tad confused. Said school wasn't what I remembered it as. I've had nothing but subpar professors who often go MIA and peers who organized cheating rings. **I can't help but feel that this has dampened my fond memories for the school and that it has undermined my sense of accomplishment in transferring here.**

&#x200B;

\*\* Is it ever too late to celebrate? Part of me feels sad because I don't think I ever truly celebrated getting into Berkeley last year. I actually hid my acceptance from my family for a few weeks to have a big surprise. That worked but I sort of wish that I had champagne, good food, the works you know?

&#x200B;

\*\* This is funny because I tell the kids I mentor to break things down from the bigger picture but I'm at a loss of words with my own advice. (I guess I can guide people to treasures I can't possess haha.) Nonetheless, I figured that I'd post this (i.e. my journal) since I know quite a few other transfers are feeling along the same vein right now :(",
