I.

&#x200B;

Rain lashed against the dorm window, a relentless tattoo blurring the California sunshine into a hazy memory. Inside, Jack hunched over a wobbly wooden desk, the stale air thick with the smell of books and unwashed laundry. His fingertips grazed the bottom of a flimsy paper cup, the once-steaming dark roast now a bitter chill mocking his loneliness. He craved more than caffeine, more than the sterile white walls that amplified his solitude. He yearned for the fire crackle of a New England hearth, the sting of snow on his cheeks, the warmth of connection, even if it was just a memory.

&#x200B;

Then, a splash of defiance against the rain-washed grey, a flash of blue sliced through the monotony. Nestled among piles of notes and forgotten books, a package pulsed with an otherworldly gleam. The elegant script danced on the cardboard, a forgotten blizzard whispering her name. Hope flickered in Jack's chest, a fragile flame battling the storm outside and the emptiness within.

&#x200B;

With trembling fingers, he tore open the package, the wind howling its approval as the aroma of brine and butter punched through the stale dorm air. Inside, nestled in ice packs, lay the ghost of a Boston blizzard: a feast of scarlet lobster and creamy chowder, sent with a mischievous wink from across the miles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

II.

&#x200B;

The New England blizzard howled its icy symphony outside, painting the quaint Cambridge cafe windows with swirling white strokes. Inside, warmth pulsed like a defiant heartbeat, fueled by steaming mugs and the embers of a newfound connection. Jack, pen hovering over a blank page, felt the familiar chill of writer's block gnawing at his creative spirit. He sighed, frustration a frosty breath on his tongue.

&#x200B;

Then, a voice, seasoned with years of unraveling the universe's mysteries, cut through the cafe's murmur. ""Still wrestling with elusive ideas, dear boy? Or has inspiration finally flown west for the warmer embrace of California sun?""

&#x200B;

Jack's head snapped up to find Professor Eleanor, his father's old colleague and a whirlwind of silver hair and sharp wit, peering over his worn notebook. Memories flooded back—shared jokes whispered over string theory diagrams, hushed debates about dark matter fueled by chocolate croissants, the way her eyes danced with the same playful glint when discussing black holes as when reciting Milton.

&#x200B;

A bittersweet smile, like the warmth of a forgotten dream, settled on Jack's face. ""Professor Eleanor, what equation led you outside the hallowed halls? Is there a cosmic conundrum brewing in these city streets?""""

&#x200B;

Her chuckle, a familiar melody through the years, held a touch of wistful understanding. ""Even mathematicians, and aspiring poets for that matter, need escapes from the tyranny of formulas, dear boy. Though I must confess, I wasn't expecting to find a wandering verse weaver grappling with cosmic conundrums in this particular haven.""

&#x200B;

Their conversation, a graceful waltz between equations and metaphors like the old days, flowed around them. He spoke of his struggles to weave physics into his verses, the frustration of translating the language of science into the rhythm of poetry. She, in turn, painted a picture of his father beyond the theorems, the way he saw sonnets in superstrings and haiku in Higgs bosons, the twinkle in his eyes when discussing the Big Bang as if it were a celestial symphony.

&#x200B;

But in the quiet spaces between words, a shadow lingered. The loss of Jack's father, still echoed in the halls of academia and the depths of his heart. Eleanor, his father's confidante and mentor, had witnessed Jack's struggle, the guilt and grief woven into his ambition to forge his own path.

&#x200B;

""He'd be proud,"" she said softly, her hand resting on his. ""He might have teased you about the lack of numbers in your poems, but he'd see the fire in your words, the same fire that ignited his equations.""

&#x200B;

Her words, like a gentle hand on a sore spot, brought tears to Jack's eyes. A moment of connection, a bridge between generations and passions. In that snow-drenched haven, they weren't just an old colleague of daddy and a struggling writer, but two souls bound by a shared love for a brilliant mathematician, their encounter a spark of hope and healing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

III.

&#x200B;

But now, a bittersweet note hung in the air. Jack's plane to Berkeley awaited, beckoning him back to studies and life on the Left Coast. He hugged Professor Eleanor farewell, a shared understanding in their eyes.

&#x200B;

""Keep weaving your celestial sonnets, Jack,"" she said, her voice laced with gentle encouragement. ""Berkeley may be miles away, but the universe we share sings the same song, wherever we are.""

&#x200B;

Jack nodded ever so slightly. ""And who knows,"" he said, eyes gleaming with newfound resolve, ""perhaps someday, those sonnets will find their way back to Cambridge, a melody for a snowy haven.""

&#x200B;

The blizzard continued its mournful symphony outside, casting a chill against the cafe's warmth. Jack stared at the clock, his heart leaden with the weight of parting. Professor Eleanor, sensing his sorrow, squeezed his hand. ""Wish we could share that lobster roll at our usual spot,"" she sighed, her eyes mirroring the snow's melancholic swirl. ""But tomorrow steals you back to California.""

&#x200B;

A smile, tinged with sadness, touched Jack's lips. ""Maybe next time,"" he said, hoping the words held a whisper of truth.

&#x200B;

A mischievous glint sparked in Eleanor's eyes as she chuckled. ""Next time it is,"" she promised. ""And until then, you'll have a taste of New England on your doorstep. I know just the place—the best damn mail-order lobster and chowder this side of the Atlantic.""

Beautiful! Absolutely beautiful job!
*""...Inside, Jack hunched over a wobbly wooden desk, the stale air thick with the smell of books and unwashed laundry...""*

Wait, he didn't do his laundry after Finals but before he went home for break? That's when you're *supposed* to do the laundry; once a year. 

He left it unwashed in his closed up dorm room all during the break? No wonder he's despondent!
*'twas the night before Christmas*
Jack Mehoff, at it again
Congrats or sorry that happened
That's the end but also the beginning.
Thanks!
Unfortunately no :-)  Thanks for reading, love your squirrel pastas!
Always love to see amazing writing!
Thanks!  The squirrels pretty much just write themselves. :-)

Good fortune with your continued writing. 

You know, there's a long history of campus fiction that loosely goes under the heading of ""college novels"".  Generally (but not always) they follow the life of one student (usually a male, usually a freshman) through one academic year, with all the travails, excitements, consternation, distractions, and triumphs students would typically encounter at a particular campus in a particular era. Most of them were written by alumni, and some are excellent literature, not just genre writing.

Four of the best set at Berkeley are:

*For the Blue and Gold,* Joy Lichtenstein (who would later be the head librarian for the city of San Francisco.). Set in the late 1890s/early 1900s, following the life of one initially innocent freshman. Probably the first such novel featuring Cal, although there were short fiction stories about students written before it.

*The Western Shore*, Clarkson Crane. Set in the 1920s at Cal. Crane was an alumnus living in Paris when he wrote it. Regarded as an excellent ""Lost Generation"" novel, and with some dark themes ahead of its time--it follows the lives of several Cal students, faculty, and alumni.  Few, if any, of them have happy or conventional lives. If there's one book I'd recommend reading in this genre, it's this one.

*Stacy Towers*, Robert K.K. Walter. 1963. Set at a fictional state university campus roughly modeled on Berkeley in the 50s/early 60s. Like *The Western Shore*, a large cast of characters including African-American students trying to make their way in a largely white campus, and liberal professors / administrators struggling against the political forces of the right-wing McCarthy era.   

*Trading Places*, David Lodge. Set in the late 1960s at a fictionalized Berkeley called ""Euphoria State"" (which is across the Bay from the ""Silver Span Bridge""), as well as a fictionalized red brick campus in the English industrial Midlands. A brashly American Berkeley professor and a stereotypical ""English professor"", literally ""trade places"" (including jobs, teaching roles, campus offices and...um....some other things) for a year in a faculty exchange program. Very humorous and well written. Lodge was a English professor who did visit / teach at Berkeley for a while, so he was writing from personal experience. Lodge followed up with two other novels with some of the same characters, so sometimes they're packaged as his ""campus trilogy"". 

Jack London (who briefly studied at Cal, also wrote a futurist dystopian novella set in part at Berkeley, called *The Scarlet Plague*. Spoiler; virtually everyone dies. You can find it online, on Google Books, I think. It's in the public domain.
Amazing info!!! Thanks I will follow up on this"
